      <description>R 3.4.0 and devel tags are now available in the Rocker versioned stack, and latest has been updated to 3.4.0.
This means you can now run something like:
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 rocker/tidyverse:devel to test out a recent version1 of R devel in RStudio with the tidyverse packages already installed. Note that the packages are not themselves devel versions (e.g. from GitHub) but are instead the latest versions from CRAN, just as in the latest tag.</description>

      <description>After OpenWetWare (2010), Wordpress (2010 - 2012) and Jekyll (2012 - 2017), I move platforms once again: now to Hugo. Why the move? As usual, this site remains a way for me to explore new technologies, but the cutting edge is by no means the allure which leads me to migrate. Rather, I find myself ever trying to move towards simpler platforms, what’s easier to maintain, free to host, easier to replicate, and what makes best use of the most widely available and well-maintained existing software and avoids unncessary custom hacks.</description>
