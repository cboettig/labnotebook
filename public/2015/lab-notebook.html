<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>I have been keeping an open lab notebook now since <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/02/02/The-Lab-Notebook-Goes-Open-.html">February of 2010</a> <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Those years have seen 271, 301, 164, 136, 86 and 44 posts, respectively. The notebook started on <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Lab_Notebook">OpenWetWare</a>, with code on (now defunct) Google Code (using svn!). <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/10/21/spatial-warning-signals-power-etc.html">By October</a> of that year I had moved to a Wordpress.org platform running on DreamHost, with code moving to GitHub earlier that year. Wordpress meant my own domain name, control of layout and plugins, better mobile support, and perhaps most importantly, avoided the occasional day-long down-times I had seen on OpenWetWare. By the end of 2010 I had also cobbled together <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/12/11/socialr-an-r-package-to-track-the-status-of-computations-with-social-network-tools.html">a system</a> in which my scripts committed themselves to GitHub and automatically posted figures the generated to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cboettig">flickr</a> that included the Git hash. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html">Knitr</a> was first released to CRAN in January of 2012, and by March I announced a <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/03/21/knitr-github-and-a-new-phase-for-the-lab-notebook.html">new phase</a> for my lab notebook focused on notes written with knitr markdown living on GitHub. For the first time, part of the daily research narrative lived not directly in the lab notebook itself (thus the decline in total notebook posts starting that year). Most of my posts in the first two years are much more journal like; reflecting on what I have been working on or reading earlier that day, describing some equation or graph, or muddling over a sticking point. Some of this remained in the notebook, particularly for work unconnected to code (thoughts on some literature, mathematical derivations, etc), but more migrated to knitr documents outside of the notebook. While knitr brought the code, results, and discussion elements closer together, it also often meant I was writing with less distance from the results, and so the text shifted towards more technical and less reflective content. Notebook entries became more brief and bullet pointed, though also punctuated by an increasing frequency of notebook entries that really were blog posts, aimed at an audience and sometimes drawing lengthy comment sections, primarily on topics related to open science and research workflow.</p>
<p>In May of 2012, I then shifted platforms again, this time <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/01/Jekyll-vs-Wordpress.html">moving to Jekyll</a>, primarily for reasons of performance and cost (as detailed in that post). I have always experimented heavily with different features and technology connected to the lab notebook, and Jekyll also opened new possibilities. Meanwhile, it fit nicely into the git/markdown-centric workflow I had already adapted. This made it easy to turn knitr outputs into notebook entries, though I waffled back on forth on whether it was more natural to post such material in the relevant project repository in GitHub or directly into the notebook. The notebook remained the home for work not (yet) connected to a project, and for blog posts, and occasionally cross-posted material on a particular project, often capturing a key result. Meanwhile more of my other work became open – in particular, I began writing my manuscripts in public GitHub project repositories from the start, and also making greater use of GitHub issues in projects. The end of 2012 also saw me leave graduate school and begin a post-doc, luckily with advisers that were equally neutral to my open notebook habit.</p>
<p>The start of 2015 saw the next significant evolution in platform. Though still based on Jekyll, I first I broke up what had been growing into one rather large <code>labnotebook</code> repo on GitHub into separate repos by year. This left me with a more lightweight repository and freed me to experiment with infrastructure without breaking all my old posts. I <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html">began writing</a> all posts directly in knitr’s <code>.Rmd</code> format, allowing the code to be run automatically when the site was published, rather than executing it locally and copying over a <code>.md</code> file into the notebook. That this was possible is thanks to my adoption of Docker (making the myriad dependencies portable), Continuous integration platforms that could run the code (using the Docker container) and automatically push the compiled site, and <code>servr</code>, another Yihui Xie R package that facilitates knitr+jekyll integration. Some entries involved particularly heavy computation, including a few that required several hours on a large Amazon EC2 machine to complete. <code>knitr</code>’s caching feature made it easy to snapshot these caches (which I did in a somewhat convoluted way with another docker container) so that the whole site could still be rebuilt on a public CI service (primarily circle-ci) within the 50 minute permitted window. The Docker+knitr+CI combination brought reproducible to a new level, though still not perfectly automated, since changing dependencies can still have some effect, particularly since I allow the container to be rebuilt from Dockerfile rather than committed as a binary image. I’ve been pleased that this system has worked remarkably well the entire year, though I’m frequently nervous that some piece of its increasingly complex architecture will break. Moreover, the complicated re-running of all the R code was increasingly redundant as most of my work continued to happen in GitHub repositories which had largely adopted their own system of continuous integration and unit testing (for basic functions and final results, if not for individual notebook posts).</p>
<p>More and more, GitHub, knitr, and other such tools have allowed me to actually perform my research openly, not just discuss it in an open notebook. Perhaps ironically, this means less and less content in the ‘lab notebook’ itself (as I <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html">wrote in 2012</a>, ‘the real notebook is on GitHub’). Interestingly, this has the side effect of making the ‘lab notebook’ much less visible. Living on my website, my open notebook has been hard to miss; a visitor could easily page through the entries to see what I had done recently without any of the familiarity it requires to navigate to the same material on GitHub. The idea that this was a scientist’s <em>notebook</em>, a concept both immediately familiar and yet so rarely public, perhaps gave it an out-sized significance to having the same material scattered around GitHub (some under my account and other work in various GitHub Organization accounts), where openness was already the norm. It attracted the attention of <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/vita#media-interviews">reporters</a> and, I’m told, my faculty search committee. So while I think <em>I</em> have benefited from this visibility, for the science it is perhaps much the same.</p>
<p>Halfway though 2015 also saw a different kind of change to my notebook as I transitioned from a post-doc to a faculty position. Just as my homepage (now maintained in its own GitHub repo, though still appearing in the same theme as my notebook) shifted from being “me” to being “my research group,” part of my time also shifted from “my research” to mentoring the research of others. While I continue to believe in transparency in scientific process and results, I have also appreciated that as a graduate student open science was something I was allowed to choose for myself. I want those I mentor to make their own choices as well. Thus we have begun projects with students primarily in private GitHub repositories (now hosted on <a href="https://github.com/boettiger-lab">github.com/boettiger-lab</a>).</p>
<p>So what does this mean for 2016 and the future of my open lab notebook? I suspect it will continue in its role as occasional blog and communication tool, where it’s greater visibility has a practical use, while becoming simpler technically, with the day-to-day of research (&amp; teaching, etc) activity confined to their own repositories.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic"> 17 Dec 2015</p>

<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>I was recently asked to describe what my typical workflow would look for running R on a cloud machine, such as digitalocean.<br />So, here’s a typical use:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">
<span class="co">## Create digitalocean machine</span>
<span class="kw">docker-machine</span> create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size 1gb --digitalocean-access-token <span class="ot">$DO_TOKEN</span> dev

<span class="co">## Point docker-engine at the the new machine</span>
<span class="kw">eval</span> <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">docker-machine</span> env dev<span class="ot">)</span>

<span class="co">## Launch the Rocker container running RStudio</span>
<span class="kw">docker</span> run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<span class="ot">$PASSWORD</span> rocker/hadleyverse

<span class="co">## Open browser at the IP address (e.g. mac-based terminal command)</span>
<span class="kw">open</span> http://<span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">docker-machine</span> ip dev<span class="ot">)</span>:8787</code></pre>
<p>From there, login with username “rstudio” and password you chose (will default to rstudio if nothing was given) and you’re good to go. RStudio has a nice git GUI which is a good way to move content on and off the instance, but I would also teach <code>docker commit</code> and <code>docker push</code> at the end as a way to capture the whole runtime (e.g. any packages installed, cached binaries from knitr, etc):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">
<span class="kw">docker</span> commit <span class="kw">&lt;</span>hash<span class="kw">&gt;</span> username/myimage
<span class="kw">docker</span> push username/myimage </code></pre>
<p>(Using to the the private image slot if you don’t want your image &amp; results public)</p>
<p>It would probably be good to cover the non-interactive case too, which is helpful when you want to do a really long run of something that needs a bigger computer than your laptop. IMHO this is where docker-machine excels because it’s easy to have the machine shut down when all is finished! e.g.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">## As before</span>
<span class="kw">docker-machine</span> create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size 1gb --digitalocean-access-token <span class="ot">$DO_TOKEN</span> dev
<span class="kw">eval</span> <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">docker-machine</span> env dev<span class="ot">)</span>

<span class="co">## Let&#39;s use the committed image since it can already have my script included</span>
<span class="kw">docker</span> run --name batch username/myimage Rscript myscript.R

<span class="co">## commit using container name &amp; push back up</span>
<span class="kw">docker</span> commit batch username/myimage
<span class="kw">docker</span> push username/myimage 

<span class="co">## Script stops machine now</span>
<span class="kw">docker-machine</span> rm -f dev</code></pre>
<p>Clearly that can be modified to pull scripts down with git and push results back up to github rather than using docker commit to snapshot and push the whole image every time. Just add env vars for authentication.</p>
<p>Provided runs are &lt; 1 hr, this workflow can rather easily be applied to a continuous integration system such as Travis or Circle-CI, (which both support Docker), instead of using docker-machine to create a private cloud instance. This provides a very simple way to bring continuous integration testing and content (re)generation to individual research results.</p>

<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">&quot;nimble&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">&quot;lazyeval&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Can we declare the <code>nimbleCode</code> parts in sections? Such as defining the model and priors in separate, reusable code blocks? Here’s a “model” block:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">model &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nimbleCode</span>({
  for (i in <span class="dv">1</span>:N){
    theta[i] ~<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dgamma</span>(alpha,beta)
    lambda[i] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>theta[i]*t[i]
    x[i] ~<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dpois</span>(lambda[i])
  }
})</code></pre>
<p>We may also wish to define the priors separately, and with specified list of hyperparameters for the priors. Perhaps the need to use <code>quote</code> and to specify each line as a list item, instead of as a block defined with <code>{</code>, is not ideal, but non-standard evaluation is a bit of a wild west still.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">hyperparameters &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dt">lambda =</span> <span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="dt">a =</span> <span class="fl">0.1</span>, <span class="dt">b =</span> <span class="fl">1.0</span>)

priors &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nimbleCode</span>({
  alpha ~<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dexp</span>(lambda)
  beta ~<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dgamma</span>(a,b)
})</code></pre>
<p>Having done so, we can construct a <code>nimbleCode</code> block by passing our chosen hyperparameters to the priors and concatenating the model and priors.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">P &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.expression</span>(<span class="kw">sapply</span>(priors, lazyeval::interp, <span class="dt">.values =</span> hyperparameters)[-<span class="dv">1</span>])
pumpCode &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(model, P)</code></pre>
<p>The result appears to work as a functional <code>nimbleCode</code> block; though note the resulting expression is not quite identical to the one we would typically write (e.g. without commas):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pumpCode</code></pre>
<pre><code>expression({
    for (i in 1:N) {
        theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha, beta)
        lambda[i] &lt;- theta[i] * t[i]
        x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])
    }
}, alpha ~ dexp(1), beta ~ dgamma(0.1, 1))</code></pre>
<p>Here we just specify the rest of the model:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pumpConsts &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dt">N =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>,

<p><span></span></p>
<p style="font-style:italic"> 03 Aug 2015</p>

<article>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>We’re happy to announce the launch of a CRAN-style repository for rOpenSci at <a href="http://packages.ropensci.org" class="uri">http://packages.ropensci.org</a></p>
<p>This repository contains the latest nightly builds from the master branch of all rOpenSci packages currently on GitHub. This allows users to install development versions of our software without specialized functions such as <code>install_github()</code>, allows dependencies not hosted on CRAN to still be resolved automatically, and permits the use of <code>update.packages()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-repository">Using the repository</h2>
<p>To use, simply add <code>packages.ropensci.org</code> to your existing list of R repos, such as:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">options</span>(<span class="dt">repos =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">getOption</span>(<span class="st">&quot;repos&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<p>(If you don’t have any default CRAN mirrors selected yet by <code>getOption(&quot;repos&quot;)</code>, you may want to add one now). You can also include this line in specific <code>install.packages()</code> requests:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;taxize&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">repos =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Our goal in creating a CRAN-style package repository (yes, it’s confusing that we use the word “repository” to describe both an individual package source in a GitHub <em>repo</em> as well as a collection of package binaries on a CRAN-like <em>repo</em>… sorry) was to provide users with a way to install the latest development versions of rOpenSci packages that offerred an easier and more seamless alternative to the widely used method of <code>devtools::install_github()</code>. This would be particularly useful for updating all packages at once, or installing development versions that depended on other versions of packages not yet released to CRAN. As an added benefit, we also wanted a system that would allow us to compute anonmyzed download statistics, analogous to what RStudio provides for it’s CRAN mirror. Getting this all to work required the introduction of a few additional technologies.</p>
<h3 id="drat-and-drat.builder"><code>drat</code> and <code>drat.builder</code></h3>
<p>While the basic structure of a CRAN-like R repository is simple, used both platforms such as rForge as well as individual developers, kudos really goes to Dirk Eddelbuettel’s <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat">drat</a> package for really making this automated, simple, and fun. While <code>drat</code> makes it easy to toss individual packages into a CRAN-like repo (which we often refer to as a <code>drat</code> repo), we needed an easy &amp; automatic way to add a whole list of packages, given their GitHub repos. Rich FitzJohn’s new <a href="https://github.com/richfitz/drat.builder">drat.builder</a> package does precisely this; handling the downloading of packages with some clever record-keeping to avoid building and adding packages which have not changed since the last time the <code>drat</code> repo was built. The sources for building the rOpenSci packages repository can be found in our “drat” GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drat" class="uri">https://github.com/ropensci/drat</a></p>
<h3 id="dynamic-package-lists-ropkgs">Dynamic package lists: <code>ropkgs</code></h3>
<p>With rOpenSci, we wanted to take this one step further. No one wants to have to maintain one more list that must be updated every time a package is successfully on-boarded to the project. Scott Chamberlain’s work with <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/ropkgs">ropkgs</a> provides a convenient way to query the rOpenSci software suite, automatically generating a list of available rOpenSci packages, and filtering them on relevant metadata, such as those that are in good status and installable condition, like so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ropkgs&quot;</span>)
out &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ro_pkgs</span>()
good &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>out$packages$status ==<span class="st"> &quot;good&quot;</span>
installable &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>out$packages$installable
pkgs &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>out$packages$name[installable &amp;<span class="st"> </span>good]</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-continuous-integration-circleci">the magic of continuous integration: CircleCI</h3>
<p>With <code>ropkgs</code>, <code>drat</code> and <code>drat.builder</code>, we now have everything we need to automate the building of the CRAN-like package repository. Now we just need some computing resource that can do the hard work of pulling down all the GitHub packages, building the repository, and securely sending off the binaries somewhere they can be downloaded. Continuous Integration systems turn out to be perfect for this. My favorite CI platform at the moment is <a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCi</a>, for several reasons particularly relevant here:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has a rich API which includes support for <code>POST</code> requests which can trigger a build without making commits to GitHub</li>
<li>it supports custom Docker containers, allowing us to just download a container with most or all the dependencies we need to build packages, etc., without having to wait for them to install manually from source first.</li>
<li>it has a convient web interface for providing secure credentials we’ll need to publish the binary repository to GitHub or Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Circle has other advantages too, like great live help and the ability to ssh into your CI run to troubleshoot when all else fails, but otherwise works like most other CI platforms. More on that another day. You can see the daily builds here: <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/ropensci/drat/tree/gh-pages">CircleCi</a>, which are triggered by a simple <code>POST</code> request running as a cron job. The <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drat/blob/gh-pages/circle.yml">circle.yml</a> configuration file appears in the project’s drat repo – check out how simple it is!</p>
<h3 id="publishing-to-amazon">Publishing to Amazon</h3>
<p>The last step would be getting download logs; which is somewhat more complicated than it sounds. <code>drat</code> convienently already handles pushing packages to GitHub’s gh-pages, a free and easy way to provide static hosting. This is free and easy, but isn’t ideal, particularly for large and frequently updated package collections. Also, it is impossible to get download logs from this approach. To avoid these issues, we settled on pushing our package repository to a static site hosted through Amazon’s S3 data storage “buckets.” It’s not free, but for at most a few gigs of space we’ll need it’s still very cost effective. In particular, S3 buckets can generate their own log files, which provides a way to count package downloads.</p>
<p>Secure communication with Amazon S3 system is accomplished using the very nacsent / actively developing <a href="https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3">aws.s3</a> R package from the awesome <a href="https://cloudyr.github.io/">cloudyr</a> project.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-the-download-logs">Parsing the download logs</h3>
<p>Amazon’s S3 logs are rather raw and require some good ol data tidying work to transform them into the conveniently parsed, tidied and IP-address-anonymized format used by RStudio’s download logs. Eventually this too can be accomplished by the CircleCI builds, but at the moment is too computationally intensive for them. A script for this workflow can be found in the project repo, <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drat/blob/gh-pages/parse_s3_logs.R">parse_s3_logs.R</a>. As the data accumulate we should be able to start publishing the tidy logs.</p>
<p>This project is still in it’s early days, and as ever, we welcome feedback, problems or ideas on the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drat/issues">issues tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and install or update some packages from the shiny new <a href="http://packages.ropensci.org" class="uri">http://packages.ropensci.org</a>!</p>

<p>From Reed (1979) we know that the optimal solution is a constant-escapement rule when the growth function in convex. Note that this condition is violated by the growth function with alternative stable states (Allen/Ricker-Allee model), resulting in a very different optimal policy:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[f&#39;(s^*) = 1/\alpha\]</span></p>
<p>For growth-rate function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the discount factor and <span class="math">\(s^*\)</span> the stock size for the constant escapement. Analytic solutions are clearly possible for certain growth functions, but here I’ve just implemented a generic numerical solution.</p>
