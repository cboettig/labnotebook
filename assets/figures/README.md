## Figure repository

This is my figure repository, replacing external hosting on Flickr, etc.  See [this post](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/11/30/Note-on-notebook-figures.html)


Copies are kept locally and on server in this directory.  Excluded from site build via Jekyll `_config.yml` for speed though, as making a copy in `_site` confuses rsync and results in having to copy the identical file over again.
