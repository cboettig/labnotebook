# Applicable courses

I believe I would be qualified to teach any of the lower-division classes and the following upper-division classes:

* AMS114: Introduction to Dynamical Systems 
* AMS115: Stochastic Modeling in Biology 
* AMS118: Estimation and Introduction to Control of Stochastic Processes 
* AMS147: Computational Methods and Applications 
* AMS162: Design and Analysis of Computer Simulation Experiments 


I would most excel in teaching courses involving biological applications, as I have a broad base of experience in seeing such courses taught (at both molecular and macroscopic scales) and am quite familiar with the education literature in this area as well.  I have experience with a wide variety of computer programming environments and teaching programming tools to biologists, and feel I could do well in most computational or programming focused courses.   

I find the case-study approach to learning both powerful and generally well-supported in the education research literature, and would be particularly interested in these courses (e.g. Case-study approach to Calculus).  


# Teaching statement


Philosophy
----------

I am passionate about experiential, active learning that is
problem-based, social, interdisciplinary, quantitative and leverages
technology. Though borne out of my own experience as both student and instructor,
my approach is also influenced by the examples of such thinkers
as Professor [Eric Mazur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI)
and [Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html).
Good teaching practices should be rooted in scientific study, not
anecdote; and much of this philosophy is well borne out in the educational
research literature.  Pieces that have been particularly influential for
me include the evidence for the value of collaborative problem-solving
in science education (Anderson et al. 2011); the immense evidence for
active learning, (Cornelius-White 2007); the road-map for quantitative,
interdisciplinary and research driven biology training (Bialek and
Botstein 2004). I am also interested in how approaches such as the use
of social media (Junco, Heiberger, and Loken 2010) and peer instruction
can bring some of the benefits of small classes into large lectures.

Experience
----------

I have been an instructor at the [Bodega Phylogenetics Workshop
(2011)](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/2011_Workshop), an intensive
1-week course that draws about 40 students from around the world to
learn the latest methods in phylogenetics. I teach a
[section](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Continuous_Character_Evolution_%28Boettiger%29_2011)
on comparative methods and basic programming. I taught upper-division
undergraduate students in biology, mathematics and computers science
through the NSF training initiative [CLIMB](http://climb.ucdavis.edu/)
(Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology)
program at UC Davis in spring and summer of 2008. A diverse group of
eight students designed and conducted a research project into
meta-population dynamics of avian influenza and organized a conference
of academics, state epidemiologists, and representatives from chicken
industry to present and discuss their findings. I have been a teaching
assistant for introductory biology (1B), a lab-driven course introducing
students to fundamentals of zoology. I have been involved in outdoor
education for eight years, where I have gained experience in group
dynamics and facilitation, leadership theory and active learning. On
campus I have helped lead the [Graduate Student Teaching
Community](http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com), where graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows can discuss and practice new teaching strategies.
I'm a member of the Center for Learning and Excellence at UC Davis. I
also enjoy educational outreach, particularly where it combines active
learning, technology and biology. I've worked with middle school
teachers on how to use simple computer simulation software
([netlogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) to provide an
exploratory approach to teaching ecology and evolution in the [SIRC
program](http://sasp.ucdavis.edu),
and have gave a guest lecture on ecological dynamics at [University of
the Pacific](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/843). I'm a
[member](http://www.nationallabnetwork.org/scientists/b1412e8c-1348-f09a-d368-919e80c4ee07)
of the [National Lab Network](http://www.nationallabnetwork.org) and I
keep an open [teaching
notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/categories.html#teaching)
where I reflect on my experiences.

Education Research
------------------

While teaching with CLIMB I had the chance to work alongside a graduate
student from the UC Davis department of Education who was writing her
thesis on the program, and first introduced me to some of the recent
research in effective education. Davis has several excellent research
programs in higher education, within the education department and
beyond, such as the physics education research track and the highly
successful Physics 7 program, as well as the CLIMB program. I am quite
interested educational research and a scientific approach to education,
and as such try to follow a bit of what is going on in the educational
literature. The papers mentioned above provide some of the foundational
philosophy towards education. I maintain a [Mendeley reading
list](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/530011/education)
of articles I encounter that may be of interest to others wanting to
know more about educational research.
