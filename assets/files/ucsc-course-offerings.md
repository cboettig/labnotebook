Advanced optimal control classes and advanced Bayesian classes may have more material in the "things I should know" than in the "things I know" area.  I'm not qualified for any of the PDE/fluid dynamics courses.  

I feel I could excel most in teaching anything involving biological applications, as I have a broad base of experience in seeing such courses taught (at both molecular and macroscopic scales) and am quite familiar with the education literature in this area as well.  I could do well in most computational or programming focused courses.   

I find the case-study approach to learning both powerful and generally well-supported in the education research literature, and would be particularly interested in these courses (e.g. Case-study approach to Calculus).
