   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been keeping an open lab notebook now since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/02/02/The-Lab-Notebook-Goes-Open-.html&quot;&gt;February of 2010&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Those years have seen 271, 301, 164, 136, 86 and 44 posts, respectively. The notebook started on &lt;a href=&quot;http://openwetware.org/wiki/Lab_Notebook&quot;&gt;OpenWetWare&lt;/a&gt;, with code on (now defunct) Google Code (using svn!). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/10/21/spatial-warning-signals-power-etc.html&quot;&gt;By October&lt;/a&gt; of that year I had moved to a Wordpress.org platform running on DreamHost, with code moving to GitHub earlier that year. Wordpress meant my own domain name, control of layout and plugins, better mobile support, and perhaps most importantly, avoided the occasional day-long down-times I had seen on OpenWetWare. By the end of 2010 I had also cobbled together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2010/12/11/socialr-an-r-package-to-track-the-status-of-computations-with-social-network-tools.html&quot;&gt;a system&lt;/a&gt; in which my scripts committed themselves to GitHub and automatically posted figures the generated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/cboettig&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; that included the Git hash. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html&quot;&gt;Knitr&lt;/a&gt; was first released to CRAN in January of 2012, and by March I announced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/03/21/knitr-github-and-a-new-phase-for-the-lab-notebook.html&quot;&gt;new phase&lt;/a&gt; for my lab notebook focused on notes written with knitr markdown living on GitHub. For the first time, part of the daily research narrative lived not directly in the lab notebook itself (thus the decline in total notebook posts starting that year). Most of my posts in the first two years are much more journal like; reflecting on what I have been working on or reading earlier that day, describing some equation or graph, or muddling over a sticking point. Some of this remained in the notebook, particularly for work unconnected to code (thoughts on some literature, mathematical derivations, etc), but more migrated to knitr documents outside of the notebook. While knitr brought the code, results, and discussion elements closer together, it also often meant I was writing with less distance from the results, and so the text shifted towards more technical and less reflective content. Notebook entries became more brief and bullet pointed, though also punctuated by an increasing frequency of notebook entries that really were blog posts, aimed at an audience and sometimes drawing lengthy comment sections, primarily on topics related to open science and research workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of 2012, I then shifted platforms again, this time &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/01/Jekyll-vs-Wordpress.html&quot;&gt;moving to Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, primarily for reasons of performance and cost (as detailed in that post). I have always experimented heavily with different features and technology connected to the lab notebook, and Jekyll also opened new possibilities. Meanwhile, it fit nicely into the git/markdown-centric workflow I had already adapted. This made it easy to turn knitr outputs into notebook entries, though I waffled back on forth on whether it was more natural to post such material in the relevant project repository in GitHub or directly into the notebook. The notebook remained the home for work not (yet) connected to a project, and for blog posts, and occasionally cross-posted material on a particular project, often capturing a key result. Meanwhile more of my other work became open – in particular, I began writing my manuscripts in public GitHub project repositories from the start, and also making greater use of GitHub issues in projects. The end of 2012 also saw me leave graduate school and begin a post-doc, luckily with advisers that were equally neutral to my open notebook habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of 2015 saw the next significant evolution in platform. Though still based on Jekyll, I first I broke up what had been growing into one rather large &lt;code&gt;labnotebook&lt;/code&gt; repo on GitHub into separate repos by year. This left me with a more lightweight repository and freed me to experiment with infrastructure without breaking all my old posts. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html&quot;&gt;began writing&lt;/a&gt; all posts directly in knitr’s &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; format, allowing the code to be run automatically when the site was published, rather than executing it locally and copying over a &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file into the notebook. That this was possible is thanks to my adoption of Docker (making the myriad dependencies portable), Continuous integration platforms that could run the code (using the Docker container) and automatically push the compiled site, and &lt;code&gt;servr&lt;/code&gt;, another Yihui Xie R package that facilitates knitr+jekyll integration. Some entries involved particularly heavy computation, including a few that required several hours on a large Amazon EC2 machine to complete. &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt;’s caching feature made it easy to snapshot these caches (which I did in a somewhat convoluted way with another docker container) so that the whole site could still be rebuilt on a public CI service (primarily circle-ci) within the 50 minute permitted window. The Docker+knitr+CI combination brought reproducible to a new level, though still not perfectly automated, since changing dependencies can still have some effect, particularly since I allow the container to be rebuilt from Dockerfile rather than committed as a binary image. I’ve been pleased that this system has worked remarkably well the entire year, though I’m frequently nervous that some piece of its increasingly complex architecture will break. Moreover, the complicated re-running of all the R code was increasingly redundant as most of my work continued to happen in GitHub repositories which had largely adopted their own system of continuous integration and unit testing (for basic functions and final results, if not for individual notebook posts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more, GitHub, knitr, and other such tools have allowed me to actually perform my research openly, not just discuss it in an open notebook. Perhaps ironically, this means less and less content in the ‘lab notebook’ itself (as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html&quot;&gt;wrote in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, ‘the real notebook is on GitHub’). Interestingly, this has the side effect of making the ‘lab notebook’ much less visible. Living on my website, my open notebook has been hard to miss; a visitor could easily page through the entries to see what I had done recently without any of the familiarity it requires to navigate to the same material on GitHub. The idea that this was a scientist’s &lt;em&gt;notebook&lt;/em&gt;, a concept both immediately familiar and yet so rarely public, perhaps gave it an out-sized significance to having the same material scattered around GitHub (some under my account and other work in various GitHub Organization accounts), where openness was already the norm. It attracted the attention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/vita#media-interviews&quot;&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; and, I’m told, my faculty search committee. So while I think &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have benefited from this visibility, for the science it is perhaps much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway though 2015 also saw a different kind of change to my notebook as I transitioned from a post-doc to a faculty position. Just as my homepage (now maintained in its own GitHub repo, though still appearing in the same theme as my notebook) shifted from being “me” to being “my research group,” part of my time also shifted from “my research” to mentoring the research of others. While I continue to believe in transparency in scientific process and results, I have also appreciated that as a graduate student open science was something I was allowed to choose for myself. I want those I mentor to make their own choices as well. Thus we have begun projects with students primarily in private GitHub repositories (now hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boettiger-lab&quot;&gt;github.com/boettiger-lab&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for 2016 and the future of my open lab notebook? I suspect it will continue in its role as occasional blog and communication tool, where it’s greater visibility has a practical use, while becoming simpler technically, with the day-to-day of research (&amp;amp; teaching, etc) activity confined to their own repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Docker Workflows</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/12/17/docker-workflows.html"/>
   <updated>2015-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/12/17/docker-workflows</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked to describe what my typical workflow would look for running R on a cloud machine, such as digitalocean.&lt;br /&gt;So, here’s a typical use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Create digitalocean machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size 1gb --digitalocean-access-token &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$DO_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; dev

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Point docker-engine at the the new machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; env dev&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Launch the Rocker container running RStudio&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt; rocker/hadleyverse

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Open browser at the IP address (e.g. mac-based terminal command)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; http://&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; ip dev&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:8787&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, login with username “rstudio” and password you chose (will default to rstudio if nothing was given) and you’re good to go. RStudio has a nice git GUI which is a good way to move content on and off the instance, but I would also teach &lt;code&gt;docker commit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker push&lt;/code&gt; at the end as a way to capture the whole runtime (e.g. any packages installed, cached binaries from knitr, etc):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;hash&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; username/myimage
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; push username/myimage &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Using to the the private image slot if you don’t want your image &amp;amp; results public)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would probably be good to cover the non-interactive case too, which is helpful when you want to do a really long run of something that needs a bigger computer than your laptop. IMHO this is where docker-machine excels because it’s easy to have the machine shut down when all is finished! e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## As before&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size 1gb --digitalocean-access-token &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$DO_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; dev
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; env dev&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Let&amp;#39;s use the committed image since it can already have my script included&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run --name batch username/myimage Rscript myscript.R

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## commit using container name &amp;amp; push back up&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; commit batch username/myimage
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; push username/myimage 

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;## Script stops machine now&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; rm -f dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly that can be modified to pull scripts down with git and push results back up to github rather than using docker commit to snapshot and push the whole image every time. Just add env vars for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided runs are &amp;lt; 1 hr, this workflow can rather easily be applied to a continuous integration system such as Travis or Circle-CI, (which both support Docker), instead of using docker-machine to create a private cloud instance. This provides a very simple way to bring continuous integration testing and content (re)generation to individual research results.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nimble Model Construction</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/08/27/nimble-model-construction.html"/>
   <updated>2015-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/08/27/nimble-model-construction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;nimble&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;lazyeval&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we declare the &lt;code&gt;nimbleCode&lt;/code&gt; parts in sections? Such as defining the model and priors in separate, reusable code blocks? Here’s a “model” block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;model &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;nimbleCode&lt;/span&gt;({
  for (i in &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:N){
    theta[i] ~&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;dgamma&lt;/span&gt;(alpha,beta)
    lambda[i] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;theta[i]*t[i]
    x[i] ~&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;dpois&lt;/span&gt;(lambda[i])
  }
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also wish to define the priors separately, and with specified list of hyperparameters for the priors. Perhaps the need to use &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt; and to specify each line as a list item, instead of as a block defined with &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;, is not ideal, but non-standard evaluation is a bit of a wild west still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;hyperparameters &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;lambda =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;a =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;b =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;)

priors &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;nimbleCode&lt;/span&gt;({
  alpha ~&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;dexp&lt;/span&gt;(lambda)
  beta ~&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;dgamma&lt;/span&gt;(a,b)
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done so, we can construct a &lt;code&gt;nimbleCode&lt;/code&gt; block by passing our chosen hyperparameters to the priors and concatenating the model and priors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;P &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;as.expression&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sapply&lt;/span&gt;(priors, lazyeval::interp, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.values =&lt;/span&gt; hyperparameters)[-&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;])
pumpCode &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(model, P)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result appears to work as a functional &lt;code&gt;nimbleCode&lt;/code&gt; block; though note the resulting expression is not quite identical to the one we would typically write (e.g. without commas):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;pumpCode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression({
    for (i in 1:N) {
        theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha, beta)
        lambda[i] &amp;lt;- theta[i] * t[i]
        x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])
    }
}, alpha ~ dexp(1), beta ~ dgamma(0.1, 1))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we just specify the rest of the model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;pumpConsts &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;N =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;, 
                   &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;t =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;94.3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;15.7&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;62.9&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;126&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;5.24&lt;/span&gt;,
                         &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;31.4&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;1.05&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;1.05&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;10.5&lt;/span&gt;))
pumpData &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;))
pumpInits &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;alpha =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, 
                  &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;beta =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,
                  &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;theta =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;rep&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;, pumpConsts$N))

pump &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;nimbleModel&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;code =&lt;/span&gt; pumpCode,

&lt;p&gt;and then verify that it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Cmodel &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;compileNimble&lt;/span&gt;(pump)

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>a drat repository for rOpenSci (draft for ropensci blog)</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/08/03/a-drat-repository-for-ropensci.html"/>
   <updated>2015-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/08/03/a-drat-repository-for-ropensci</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce the launch of a CRAN-style repository for rOpenSci at &lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;http://packages.ropensci.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository contains the latest nightly builds from the master branch of all rOpenSci packages currently on GitHub. This allows users to install development versions of our software without specialized functions such as &lt;code&gt;install_github()&lt;/code&gt;, allows dependencies not hosted on CRAN to still be resolved automatically, and permits the use of &lt;code&gt;update.packages()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-repository&quot;&gt;Using the repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use, simply add &lt;code&gt;packages.ropensci.org&lt;/code&gt; to your existing list of R repos, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;repos =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;getOption&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;repos&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you don’t have any default CRAN mirrors selected yet by &lt;code&gt;getOption(&amp;quot;repos&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, you may want to add one now). You can also include this line in specific &lt;code&gt;install.packages()&lt;/code&gt; requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;install.packages&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;taxize&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;repos =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal in creating a CRAN-style package repository (yes, it’s confusing that we use the word “repository” to describe both an individual package source in a GitHub &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; as well as a collection of package binaries on a CRAN-like &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt;… sorry) was to provide users with a way to install the latest development versions of rOpenSci packages that offerred an easier and more seamless alternative to the widely used method of &lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github()&lt;/code&gt;. This would be particularly useful for updating all packages at once, or installing development versions that depended on other versions of packages not yet released to CRAN. As an added benefit, we also wanted a system that would allow us to compute anonmyzed download statistics, analogous to what RStudio provides for it’s CRAN mirror. Getting this all to work required the introduction of a few additional technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;drat-and-drat.builder&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;drat.builder&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basic structure of a CRAN-like R repository is simple, used both platforms such as rForge as well as individual developers, kudos really goes to Dirk Eddelbuettel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat&quot;&gt;drat&lt;/a&gt; package for really making this automated, simple, and fun. While &lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; makes it easy to toss individual packages into a CRAN-like repo (which we often refer to as a &lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; repo), we needed an easy &amp;amp; automatic way to add a whole list of packages, given their GitHub repos. Rich FitzJohn’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/richfitz/drat.builder&quot;&gt;drat.builder&lt;/a&gt; package does precisely this; handling the downloading of packages with some clever record-keeping to avoid building and adding packages which have not changed since the last time the &lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; repo was built. The sources for building the rOpenSci packages repository can be found in our “drat” GitHub repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/drat&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ropensci/drat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dynamic-package-lists-ropkgs&quot;&gt;Dynamic package lists: &lt;code&gt;ropkgs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rOpenSci, we wanted to take this one step further. No one wants to have to maintain one more list that must be updated every time a package is successfully on-boarded to the project. Scott Chamberlain’s work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/ropkgs&quot;&gt;ropkgs&lt;/a&gt; provides a convenient way to query the rOpenSci software suite, automatically generating a list of available rOpenSci packages, and filtering them on relevant metadata, such as those that are in good status and installable condition, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ropkgs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
out &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;ro_pkgs&lt;/span&gt;()
good &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;out$packages$status ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
installable &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;out$packages$installable
pkgs &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;out$packages$name[installable &amp;amp;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;good]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-magic-of-continuous-integration-circleci&quot;&gt;the magic of continuous integration: CircleCI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;ropkgs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;drat.builder&lt;/code&gt;, we now have everything we need to automate the building of the CRAN-like package repository. Now we just need some computing resource that can do the hard work of pulling down all the GitHub packages, building the repository, and securely sending off the binaries somewhere they can be downloaded. Continuous Integration systems turn out to be perfect for this. My favorite CI platform at the moment is &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com&quot;&gt;CircleCi&lt;/a&gt;, for several reasons particularly relevant here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has a rich API which includes support for &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests which can trigger a build without making commits to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it supports custom Docker containers, allowing us to just download a container with most or all the dependencies we need to build packages, etc., without having to wait for them to install manually from source first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has a convient web interface for providing secure credentials we’ll need to publish the binary repository to GitHub or Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circle has other advantages too, like great live help and the ability to ssh into your CI run to troubleshoot when all else fails, but otherwise works like most other CI platforms. More on that another day. You can see the daily builds here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/gh/ropensci/drat/tree/gh-pages&quot;&gt;CircleCi&lt;/a&gt;, which are triggered by a simple &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request running as a cron job. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/drat/blob/gh-pages/circle.yml&quot;&gt;circle.yml&lt;/a&gt; configuration file appears in the project’s drat repo – check out how simple it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-to-amazon&quot;&gt;Publishing to Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step would be getting download logs; which is somewhat more complicated than it sounds. &lt;code&gt;drat&lt;/code&gt; convienently already handles pushing packages to GitHub’s gh-pages, a free and easy way to provide static hosting. This is free and easy, but isn’t ideal, particularly for large and frequently updated package collections. Also, it is impossible to get download logs from this approach. To avoid these issues, we settled on pushing our package repository to a static site hosted through Amazon’s S3 data storage “buckets.” It’s not free, but for at most a few gigs of space we’ll need it’s still very cost effective. In particular, S3 buckets can generate their own log files, which provides a way to count package downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure communication with Amazon S3 system is accomplished using the very nacsent / actively developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3&quot;&gt;aws.s3&lt;/a&gt; R package from the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudyr.github.io/&quot;&gt;cloudyr&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;parsing-the-download-logs&quot;&gt;Parsing the download logs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s S3 logs are rather raw and require some good ol data tidying work to transform them into the conveniently parsed, tidied and IP-address-anonymized format used by RStudio’s download logs. Eventually this too can be accomplished by the CircleCI builds, but at the moment is too computationally intensive for them. A script for this workflow can be found in the project repo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/drat/blob/gh-pages/parse_s3_logs.R&quot;&gt;parse_s3_logs.R&lt;/a&gt;. As the data accumulate we should be able to start publishing the tidy logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is still in it’s early days, and as ever, we welcome feedback, problems or ideas on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/drat/issues&quot;&gt;issues tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go ahead and install or update some packages from the shiny new &lt;a href=&quot;http://packages.ropensci.org&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;http://packages.ropensci.org&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;#R &amp;lt;- outer(states, actions, get_utility)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compare-to-reed&quot;&gt;Compare to Reed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Reed (1979) we know that the optimal solution is a constant-escapement rule when the growth function in convex. Note that this condition is violated by the growth function with alternative stable states (Allen/Ricker-Allee model), resulting in a very different optimal policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[f&amp;#39;(s^*) = 1/\alpha\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For growth-rate function &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; is the discount factor and &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(s^*\)&lt;/span&gt; the stock size for the constant escapement. Analytic solutions are clearly possible for certain growth functions, but here I’ve just implemented a generic numerical solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note we could have selected on the &lt;code&gt;tsn==164712&lt;/code&gt; to be less ambiguous but also less semantic, or on &lt;code&gt;commonname==&amp;quot;Atlantic cod&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to be more reader friendly but even more ambiguous. Fortunately the common and scientific names are well aligned with the &lt;code&gt;tsn&lt;/code&gt; ids in this case and we get the same set of 22 stock assessments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can combine across these, we must verify that each assessment measures the quantities of interest using the same units, or otherwise correct those that do not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;units %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(assessid %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cod_ids) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(assessid, catch_landings_unit) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(catch_landings_unit) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;summarise&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;(catch_landings_unit))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;units %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(assessid %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cod_ids) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(assessid, total_unit) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(total_unit) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;summarise&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;(total_unit))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

3         NA                  2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All catches are in metric tons, so no concern there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing data we can plot immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;values %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(tsyear) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;ggplot&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;aes&lt;/span&gt;(tsyear, catch)) +&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;geom_line&lt;/span&gt;() +&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;ylab&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Catch/Landings (MT)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;) +&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;xlab&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/2015/assets/figures/posts/2015-06-18-RAM-explore/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that missing data is removed, such that any assessment without catch data is treated as zero catch. This could be the case (maybe not all assessments correspond to unique catch zones.) We also assume catch reported in one assessment is not also reported in a different assement (e.g. no double-counting). Lastly, we must bear in mind that this is catch/landings data, which may include bycatch, underreporting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;handling-unit-conversions&quot;&gt;Handling unit conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The units for &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; are more problematic. The &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; simply indicates stocks that do not have the an estimate for &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;, but we also see one assessment has totals in &lt;code&gt;E03&lt;/code&gt; (thousands) instead of metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidebar&lt;/em&gt; how do we know for sure that &lt;code&gt;E03&lt;/code&gt; is abundance counts in thousands of fish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database does not provide metadata for these unit definitions directly. the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; data and its associated &lt;code&gt;units&lt;/code&gt; metadata are actually derived tables from the raw &lt;code&gt;timeseries&lt;/code&gt; table and the associated &lt;code&gt;tsmetrics&lt;/code&gt; unit metadata, so we would have to dive in there to confirm this interpretation of &lt;code&gt;E03&lt;/code&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# tidy up the tsmetrics table:&lt;/span&gt;
unit_defs &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tsmetrics %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;rename&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;tsid =&lt;/span&gt; tsunique) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(tsid, tslong, tsunitslong) 

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# Find the assessid of the cod stock assessment that measures total in units of E03&lt;/span&gt;
who &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;units %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(assessid %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cod_ids) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(assessid, total_unit) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(total_unit==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;E03&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(ts_who, unit_defs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we can confirm &lt;code&gt;E03&lt;/code&gt; is in this case &lt;code&gt;TN-E03&lt;/code&gt; (total number, in thousands).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting this to metric tons will require an average weight for cod. FishBase gives us a maximum weight (in grams):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;rfishbase::&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Gadus morhua&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;fields=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Weight&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error in loadNamespace(name): there is no package called &amp;#39;rfishbase&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says the average is 5-12 kilograms, so let’s take 8.5 Kg for sake of argument. Clearly a more programmatic and more accurate solution is needed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidenote&lt;/em&gt; the database has some very limited data on biometrics by assessment, including some assessments that record a maximum (but not an average) weight (sometimes pulled from FishBase anyway). Even pooling across all Atlantic Cod assessments we can’t find even a maximum weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# Find the unit code for max weight&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# show the unit code:&lt;/span&gt;
max_weight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gp-model&quot;&gt;GP model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GP model defined here. Basically the same as your original, but I renamed some paramters more to my liking =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as elegant as I had hoped. It still requires repeating (essentially) the same code three times. I discovered some limitations of NIMBLE while trying other approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- This achieves relatively nice simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;- There’s an efficiency hit to the MCMC sampling, but it doesn’t seem too bad.&lt;br /&gt;- This works.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lazy Evaluation Thoughts</title>

   <updated>2015-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/06/03/lazy-evaluation-thoughts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is just a draft of my reply to Gavin’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2015/06/03/my-aversion-to-pipes/&quot;&gt;thought-provoking post&lt;/a&gt; pushing back on pipes and NSE in R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavin, really nice post and discussion here. I am still conflicted about some these issues myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the issues of NSE are somewhat separate and above my concern with pipes. I agree completely with your observation that intermediate assignment is easier to read than nested assignment, and not that much harder to read than a pipe chain. However I also agree with other commenters that not having to think about intermediate assignment variables is nice (e.g. I usually do something like replacing &lt;code&gt;the_data&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; or some such in each occurrence after the first in your example to make this more explicit). But for the most part I do not find the pipe syntax to be problematic in the same way that NSE is – indeed I can use the pipe operator with the SE versions of the same functions, or with any other SE R function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSE to me is a whole different can of worms. It does make the syntax much more consise and more semantic, (even while it obfuscates what is a string, a numeric, or a variable). But this whole “don’t use it in programming” thing seems very impractical to me. When I first started R, I got the same advice – only it was for R itself – use it interactively, but for real programming write everything in C. Then maybe add some R wrappers on top. Um.. yeah, I actually did that for a few years… long ago. Most of the time I don’t even know if I’m programming or not. Sure, it’s easy to use the SE versions when working on some function you know will be part of an R package, but NSE has bitten me several times in various research scripts. Stupid things perhaps – where I have done things like changing a filter argument to a variable with the same name as a column (&lt;code&gt;filter(x == .5)&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;filter(x == x)&lt;/code&gt;) – but very difficult to debug since they do not throw errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, both the performance and consise abstractions of common manipulation tasks make it hard to walk away from &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; and friends. However, I find the syntax required to use the SE versions of the dplyr functions immensely cumbersome and opaque (e.g. http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/02/06/fun-standardizing-non-standard-evaluation.html). Some of these can be written more concisely with a different SE syntax, but having 4 different ways to introduce a variable value, not all of which cover all the same cases, is even worse to me than just sticking with the most complex. No doubt I lack appreciation of the complexity here, but it seems like it should be possible to have a syntax that is nearly as consise as the NSE but where I can replace values with variables (e.g. &lt;code&gt;filter(&amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;filter(y == x)&lt;/code&gt;) without needing something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;lapply&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;(query), function(level){
value &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;query[[level]]
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;interp&lt;/span&gt;(~y ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;x, 
&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.values =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;y =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;as.name&lt;/span&gt;(level), &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; value))
})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, apologies for the rant – just trying to say I share your hesitation regarding NSE but pipes don’t bother me. (I do think lazy eval on pipes is a win btw – e.g. try testing out the same long pipe-string analysis on data coming from a remote database; say, just to check that the first 10 rows of output look right before evaluation the whole database)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calculating-transition-probabilities&quot;&gt;Calculating transition probabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several ways we might go about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically all policies could be updated in response to new information, though this requires repeating the estimation process, or at least a Bayesian updating step (e.g. passive learning). Typically these steps are separated into estimating the policy and then implementing the policy separately, so we will focus on this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition probability is conditional&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect to the database (connection info is &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database/accessing-the-live-database&quot;&gt;public&lt;/a&gt;), works fine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

                     &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;port =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;5432&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;p&gt;However, the expected mechanism for accessing a complete table seems to fail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;(mydb, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;stock&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, direct sql queries work (note we need the full table address, e.g. &lt;code&gt;dbname.tablename&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;(mydb, &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM srdb.stock&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these tables easily fit into memory, it is generally faster to just import them into R rather than leaving &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; to just work with them remotely. The &lt;code&gt;dplyr::collect()&lt;/code&gt; function does this. So we create local copies of each table of interest like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;timeseries &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;tbl&lt;/span&gt;(mydb, &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SELECT * FROM srdb.timeseries&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)))

&lt;p&gt;Many of the tables contain observations of variables that describe each given assessment (&lt;code&gt;assessid&lt;/code&gt;), including the species &lt;code&gt;stock&lt;/code&gt; assessed, &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; assessed, the method used, and so forth. Since these all follow the same schema of a row being a unique stock assessment and a column being an attribute of that assessment, it makes sense to combine this into a single metadata table. (Especially as these datasets fit so easily into memory anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;meta &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;assessment %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(method) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(stock) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(area) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(units) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(assessor) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(management) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;left_join&lt;/span&gt;(taxonomy) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;all_areas &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stock %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;biometrics&lt;/code&gt;: definitions of said parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The column is called &lt;code&gt;biounique&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;biometrics&lt;/code&gt; table but &lt;code&gt;bioid&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;bioparams&lt;/code&gt; table, so we fix that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsmetrics&lt;/code&gt; defines the factor levels and the units used in &lt;code&gt;timeseries&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;tsid&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;tsmetrics &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tsmetrics %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;rename&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;tsid =&lt;/span&gt; tsunique)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we can see what measurements are available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note TC (total catch) and TL (total landings) are equivalent in this context, implying neglible discards.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is a lot of heterogeneity in the metrics measured by each assessment: &lt;code&gt;tsmetrics&lt;/code&gt; defines 151 units, (though only 93 appear in timeseries)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;(tsmetrics$tsid))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 151&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;(timeseries$tsid))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 93&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most are variations differing only by units, as we see from the most commonly used metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;unit_occurs &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No transformation has been done, hence the units of the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; columns vary depending on the assessment id. Nonetheless it is quite useful to have the metrics split into their corresponding 5 types rather than as 93 unique subtypes. As long as we are not comparing magnitudes across different assessments directly though, this should not be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would probably be useful to reconstruct the code to generate the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; table from the timeseries table directly. One might hope that the mappings between &lt;code&gt;tsid&lt;/code&gt; values and the five column headings in the &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; table would be defined in the database, e.g. in perhaps the &lt;code&gt;tscategory&lt;/code&gt; column of &lt;code&gt;tsmetrics&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but alas this does not quite appear to be the case (e.g. CPUE and SSB are a single category.) Some combination of this information and splitting on the &lt;code&gt;tsid&lt;/code&gt; strings would probably suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rfishbase&quot;&gt;rfishbase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rfishbase&lt;/code&gt; queries from users: getting “Resilience,” “Vulnerability” and “Price Category” data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;x &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;species_info&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Labroides bicolor&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;fields =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SpecCode&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Vulnerability&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;PriceCateg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It so happens that “Resilience” is not in that table, but in the “stocks” table instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;y &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;stocks&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Labroides bicolor&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;fields=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SpecCode&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Resilience&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now merge the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;data &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, you can see a list of all the columns in a given table by just omitting the “fields” argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;species_info&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Labroides bicolor&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the nearly 100 columns don’t fit in the page, the function just summarizes the column names for the ones that don’t fit. You can read through that list and spot the words “Vulnerability” and “PriceCateg”, and then use them in the ‘fields’ argument to just get those results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all of these functions can take a long list of species names instead of a single species, and thus will return a table with a row for each species and the desired columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that we use “SpecCode”, the species code, to identify a species on fishbase. You can use the function “speciesnames” to transform this numeric code into a species name; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;data$SpecCode &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;speciesnames&lt;/span&gt;(data$SpecCode)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Open Science Post Doc</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/04/20/open-science-post-doc.html"/>
   <updated>2015-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/04/20/open-science-post-doc</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is a response to the query posted by Titus Brown on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-how-to-find-openscience-advisor.html&quot;&gt;advice for doing an Open Science Post doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Science is a broad tent, and I believe there are many ways to engage in open science without crossing boundaries of collaborators or PIs. Some of the most valuable open science practices are those least likely to cross boundaries: in particular, those practices associated with post-publication of academic papers. Many widely regarded journals, including &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, have relatively strong data publication requirements, increasingly strong code publication expectations, and are compatible with the use of pre-print archives. Yes, their are those who would hesitate even to comply with the most minimal interpretation of these expectations; but there are many more who, given the expectation to do this at all, would appreciate your knowledge and effort on doing these things well and consistent with best practices. Using data repositories instead of supplemental material; exhibiting good management of data and code; providing good metadata in consistent formats; citing software and data appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the practices promoted by open scientists work almost as well in a setting that is closed until you ‘flip the switch’ to make them public; even if that is long after publication. Good data management, a private Github repository, or a private electronic lab notebook are all ways to leverage best practices tools and approaches in a setting that can either be shared securely or made open later. Attitudes to post-publication sharing are rarely black-and-white, and having everything curated and ready to go ahead of time can help nudge collaborators in the direction of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a post-doc for just over 2 years while enjoying a relatively open-science approach to my research: I’ve kept an open lab notebook, posted my papers ahead of publication on pre-print archives, released code, data, and knitr versions of my papers, discuss my work on social media, sign reviews, shared grant applications, contributed open source software and been active in open science communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have independent funding for most but not all of my post-doc, and to work in a field where researchers are often given substantial independence and in which open practices are common. Nonetheless these were not practices shared by either of my two excellent co-advisers, who gave only a neutral or vaguely positive response to these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I learned more about &lt;em&gt;old-school&lt;/em&gt; open science from them than I had ever imagined. When I sent Marc the first draft of our paper, I had buried almost all of the equations in a curt appendix with minimal and jargon-laden supporting text. No sir, those equations not only had to appear in the main text, but I must endeavor to explain the meaning and relevance of each one in a language clear and concise enough for any ecologist to follow. I won’t claim to have succeeded, but boy did continuous integration on my unit tests feel like a low bar for openness by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I also felt I had the support and mentorship of an online community of open scientists even without going to work for one of them. I am thankful that my mentors have always been tolerant of my open science experimentation, but I would have enjoyed working with them even if it had been otherwise. There was much to learn from them, much to learn from the open science community, and after all, a post-doc position doesn’t last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Misc Notes On Cloud Providers</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/04/15/misc-notes-on-cloud-providers.html"/>
   <updated>2015-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/04/15/misc-notes-on-cloud-providers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ongoing notes comparing computing resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing compute resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, and Google Compute Engine look significantly cheaper than Rackspace, Azure, etc. (The Economist has estimated that AWS EC2 prices are roughly 3% &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; cost).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean tends to have the lowest price point for on-demand use of a given set of resources; usually comparable to the Amazon or EC2 persistent (e.g. monthly) use. All-inclusive pricing (storage, networking etc) and limited options make choices simple and total costs easy to anticipate, though lack the flexibility to fine-tune a configuration to pay for exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google offers the best rate for higher-cpu instances, (e.g. 16 cores); primarily by provisioning them with less memory (0.9 GB/core) than DO or EC2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google configures disk space separately from instance type. Cost of $0.04 per GB for spinning disk storage, is quite a bit cheaper than the ~ $0.10/GB for AWS EBS, and in fact nearly S3 price ~ $0.03. This makes it a potentially compelling platform for high storage, low compute instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably this is non-local storage like EBS, since they also offer a (very expensive) local SSD option (limited to 375 GB increments, each inc at $81.75 / mo). Though if the non-local nature creates a significant latency, it isn’t clear why one would buy non-local SSD option for $0.17/GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-google-compute-engine&quot;&gt;Using Google Compute Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web interface is cleaner but much less flexible than Amazon’s, most tasks must be done with the commandline SDK tool instead, &lt;code&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; (such as modifying firewall settings other than port 80 and port 443). For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/#snappy-google&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on running an Ubuntu Snappy Core image instead of the usual defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker-machine makes this a bit easier, as usual. The user needs to create a project name and project id on the Google Cloud Engine web interface. Only the project-name is required as an argument to docker-machine (e.g. no authentication token), auth must be done interactively through a web terminal. It doesn’t seem that there is a way to turn on &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; port or otherwise configure the firewall. By default, all inbound ports are shut. By mapping to port &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt; and checking ‘allow http’ in the web interface one can still access an app like RStudio-server (my mapping docker ports appropriately), but there doesn’t seem to be any way to automate this. (In contrast, with Amazon EC2, docker-machine automatically attaches a ‘security-group’ called &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt;, so a user can customize the ports permitted on that security group to have, e.g. 8787 open by default.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-comparisons&quot;&gt;Performance comparisons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU performance varies within a single provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO CPUs appear 2.3 - 2.4 Ghz with ~ 15MB cache,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google CPUs around 2.6 Ghz with ~ 20MB cache,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon ~ 2.8 Ghz with ~ 25 MB cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;network i/o speeds seem reasonable on all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-resources-with-docker-machine&quot;&gt;Using resources with docker-machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker-machine with docker save: after committing the container, this saves the container locally rather than on the host. With even reasonable download speeds ~ 0.5MB/s this is quite slow. DigitalOcean download speeds are ~ 680 Mb/s, and upload about half that. Better yet, pushing the container back to the Hub only pushes the changed layers anyway, so is nearly instantaneous. The Hub also provides a private repo for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a pretty compelling workflow of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-machine create ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; user/private&lt;/code&gt; and do stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker commit container user/private&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;docker push user/private&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;docker-machine rm -f ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order to deploy one’s work on temporary machine with appropriate power, and then save the work and close the machine. Using docker instead of the standard image ‘snapshots’ is probably faster and nicely independent of the machine and provider; and in this case the snapshot storage is free of cost as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Data Science Regional Hubs</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/04/10/data-science-regional-hubs.html"/>
   <updated>2015-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/04/10/data-science-regional-hubs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;agenda&quot;&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who &amp;amp; what we have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imagine and design the hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;engage, govern, sustain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structure a proposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nsf-overview&quot;&gt;NSF overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does NSF mean by hub? Consortium/network with regional focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why regional? face time. regional issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NSF thinking it will fund for 9-10 years (in 3 phases). next phase will be &amp;lt; 3 years after first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phase 1: hub (executive director)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phase 2: spokes (priority areas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phase 3: nodes (sustaining partner organizations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteer steering council advises ED, executive staff partner organizations (beyond steering council) (model like the CRA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundational Research example: Berkeley AMPlab (NSF, DARPA, DOE, AWS, Google, SAP) -&amp;gt; apache open source: spark, mesos, tachyon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education example: Schmidt family foundation funds U Chicago run Data Science for Social Good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications: Healthcare: industry using open clinicaltrials.gov data, tidy up/visual interface (Novartis, Pfizer, Eli Lillu)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSF will fund the logistics, not the research (other NSF programs do that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;networking (meeting, staff) dynamic: grow over time Collaboration rather than competition: NSF prefers one proposal per region!! Must represent the entire region. West is the largest geographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spokes can be regional areas as well as topical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;phase 1 somewhat of a planning grant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;charratte-outcome-goals&quot;&gt;Charratte outcome goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;priority applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technical or research topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;societal big data issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteer to organize next steps in coalescing regional stakeholders and advancing the region’s proposal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will hubs interact? 2.5 day workshop at DC will talk about that after regionally focused hubs are created. Successful pilot (e.g. education) can spread nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordination between federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this group selected based on their white papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content for the proposal from the western region&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by hands, looks like 50% academic, 50% govt/non-profit (6)/for profit (6) in equal bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;table breakout. environmental science strong at my table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Tompkins (Berkeley industry), Anne Wilson (Colorado), Jeremy Franklin, Philip Tarrant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm 2: listing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing hubs and partnerships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis Capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User and Uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education &amp;amp; workforce development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakout 2: Services the hub can provide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see our sticky. i make case for demographic diversity (&amp;amp; geographic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plenary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;staff, workshops. Not funding for infrastructure, not funding research, not funding education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could fund a workshop to create an NSF call for infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;structure: could rotate between campuses. could be led by a .org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(us-ignite.org spun off. hub could spin off into a .org)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakout 3: discuss very different images for what hub would look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage diversity of approaches, rooms were given different metaphors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how could the hub be like a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals: foster research; education Matchmaking. tools + domains + data Standards. data trust. metadata. Buisness services: data management. sustainability Functions: workshops. events/hackathons. forum for curriculum development. data carpentry boot camps. standardization, containers. Governance: rotating board, transition to member funded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;body does the work.&lt;br /&gt; Facilitate communication. Directory of resources. Advocacy of best practices they must come to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modular diversity values: openness, collaboration, equality, agile built on existing infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;larger purpose/values. activities: student fellows, matchmaking, workshops spokes: natural resources, ag, natural hazards, healthcare, transportation leadership: ED. 18 person steering committee. spoke working groups Select steering committee: via an interim steering committee from the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback: plus, potential, critique,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take volunteers for co pis (google doc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take volunteers for host institution (5 volunteer: UCSD Supercomputing Center, USC (ISI), UC Berkeley (BIDS), Federation for Earth Systems, state of Utah)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;host institution volunteers meet to select host. Agreement by consensus on Federation for Earth Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following further discussion with NSF, FES agrees to a UCSD-UCB-UW led.&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare-data&quot;&gt;Prepare data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare data, as before: we filter on the stated criteria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;gpdd_main %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(SamplingProtocol ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         SourceDimension %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Index&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;), 
         SamplingFrequency ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         DatasetLength &amp;gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;arrange&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) -&amp;gt;
filtered&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and select data matching this filter. We add a column for the log of the population size and group by data ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;gpdd_data %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(MainID %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;filtered$MainID) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(MainID, Population, SampleYear) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;logN =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(Population)) -&amp;gt;
df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we replace &lt;code&gt;-Inf&lt;/code&gt; (introduced from &lt;code&gt;log(0)&lt;/code&gt; terms) with smallest finite values observed. (arbitrary, authors do not specify how these values are handled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;i &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;which&lt;/span&gt;(df$logN ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;Inf&lt;/span&gt;)
df$logN[i] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;(df$logN[-i])-&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may test on a subset of the data first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;#not run&lt;/span&gt;
some &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;(df$MainID), &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;)
df %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(MainID %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;some) -&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;import-function-definitions&quot;&gt;Import function definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We import our previous model definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;downloader::&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://github.com/ropensci/rgpdd/raw/master/inst/scripts/knape-de-valpine.R&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;knape-de-valpine.R&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;knape-de-valpine.R&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unlink&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;knape-de-valpine.R&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simulating&quot;&gt;Simulating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FKF package doesn’t bother to define a simulation method, so we can simply define one directly from the state equations. Though a C implementation would be preferrable, fitting will always be much more rate-limiting. (We will also ignore the multi-variate definition for simplicity here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;use &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;function(x, default){

    default
  else
    x
}

  GGt &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;(fit[[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;GGt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]], &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
  a0 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;fit[[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;a0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]]

  a[&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a0
    for(t in &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;:(n&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)){
      a[t&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;+1&lt;/span&gt;] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Tt *&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a[t] +&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eta[t]

    }
        y[n] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Zt *&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a[n] +&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;epsilon[n]
  y
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also creates simulated datasets based on the real data but explicitly making the assumption of either density independence (DI) or density dependence (DD). For each dataset, a density-independent simulated dataset is created by simulating under the SSRW model that was fit. The density-dependent model is created by explicitly fixing the density dependent parameter (&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt; in the language of the paper, &lt;code&gt;Tt&lt;/code&gt; in FKF notation) to 0.8 and estimating the other parameters of this modified SSG model. We can define this model analgously to the others, only this time fixing &lt;code&gt;Tt = 0.8&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;fit_dd &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;function(y,

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;tidyr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;FKF&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working through &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01702.x&quot;&gt;10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01702.x&lt;/a&gt; provides a nice way to play around with the GPDD data and Kalman filtering. More interested in exploring the data and methods than in just replicating the results, which are important but also rather intuitive and thus I expect rather robust – as we add (observational) uncertainty, or indeed, any additional parameters that must be ended, we should expect to have less power to pin down a particular parameter associated with density dependence, as the paper illustrates rather nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-preparation&quot;&gt;Data preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;627 time series with population indices obtained from the GPDD (NERC Centre for Population Biology 1999). Data sets were filtered out from the database by removing harvest and non-index based data, data sampled at non-annual intervals and time series taking less than 15 unique values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding time-series shorter than a minimum length is intuitive. Excluding harvest data makes some sense, as these aren’t scientific samples; in particular, they do not necessarily reflect a uniform sampling effort over time. Not quite clear why one would exclude non-annual intervals. Not really clear what “non-index based data” even means. Note that this 2012 paper still cites the original 1999 version instead of the 2010 version, which adds 123 datasets (for a total of 5,156).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we can roughly infer what these filters mean in terms of the columns and values defined in the “MAIN” table of the GPDD, as described in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd&quot;&gt;GPDD User Manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; makes it quick to implement these filters in R:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;gpdd_main %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(SamplingProtocol ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         SourceDimension %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Index&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;), 
         SamplingFrequency ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         DatasetLength &amp;gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;arrange&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) -&amp;gt;
filtered&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we might imagine different selection criteria, looking a bit more closely at the relevant fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately these don’t quite align with the paper, even allowing for the 123 additional datasets. Most obviously, we have 1749 matches instead of 627. Not only have we somehow grabbed more datasets than expected, but the Knape et al list includes quite a few datasets that do not meet these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://ropensci.github.io/rgpdd/data/knape.R&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(MainID %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;knape_ids) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(MainID, SamplingProtocol, SourceDimension, SamplingFrequency, DatasetLength)  %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;arrange&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;as.tbl&lt;/span&gt;() -&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;knape_data

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;(knape_data$SourceDimension)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    Count (millions)              Harvest              Unknown

&lt;p&gt;Those summaries show data with attributes we excluded, including Harvest as a sampling protocol. We see over 100 such data sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;gpdd_main %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(SamplingProtocol ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         SourceDimension %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Index&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;), 
         SamplingFrequency ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
         DatasetLength &amp;gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;dim&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 468  25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this discrepancy isn’t clear, but we can proceed with our filtered data instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting the time-series identified by our filter, we also add a column for &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(\log(N)\)&lt;/span&gt; population:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;gpdd_data %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(MainID %in%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;filtered$MainID) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;(MainID, Population, SampleYear) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(MainID) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;logN =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(Population)) -&amp;gt;
df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly there are no missing data reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sapply&lt;/span&gt;(df$Population, is.na))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;df %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(Population &amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# -9999 is elsewhere used for missing data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Source: local data frame [0 x 4]
Groups: MainID

Variables not shown: MainID (int), Population (dbl), SampleYear
  (int), logN (dbl)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but some population values are equal to 0, creating some &lt;code&gt;-Inf&lt;/code&gt; terms in our log data, which will create trouble in fitting the models. The authors don’t say how they handled this case. We will manually set them to the smallest value observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;i &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;which&lt;/span&gt;(df$logN ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;Inf&lt;/span&gt;)
df$logN[i] &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;(df$logN[-i])-&lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gompertz-model&quot;&gt;Gompertz model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the stochastic Gompertz population model to analyse the strength of density dependence in the data.The model is defined through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[N_{t+1} = N_t \exp(a - b \log N_t + \epsilon_t)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(N_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is population density or size in year &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; is an intercept, &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; is a measure of the strength of density dependence and &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(\eta\)&lt;/span&gt; is normally distributed process error with mean zero and standard deviation &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(\tau\)&lt;/span&gt;. By log transforming the population abundance and putting &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(x_t = \log N_t\)&lt;/span&gt; this simplifies to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[x_{t+1} = a + c x_t + \epsilon_t\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(c = 1 - b\)&lt;/span&gt; is the lag 1 autocorrelation of the log transformed population abundance when the process is stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and uncertainty in measurements, &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; are simply normal random variates around &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(x_t\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[y_t = x_t + \eta_t \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(\eta_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kalman-filtering&quot;&gt;Kalman Filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the model is linear we can compute the likelihood directly by means of a Kalman filter. There are various ways of going about this, and the paper provides some general details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kalman filter was initiated by assuming a wide prior distribution on the initial state centred around the first observation, &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(x_1 \sim N( y_1, 10)\)&lt;/span&gt;. For each model and data set the numerical maximisation (using the BFGS algorithm implemented in the optim function) was repeated for 50 random starting values to ensure that we found the global optimum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some useful detail here, but still a bit vague for our purposes, or are things we might have done differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t state which Kalman filter (their are a few algorithms and several packages, but the differences seem quite small: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstatsoft.org/v39/i02&quot;&gt;this JSS paper&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not clear that we wouldn’t want to scale the prior variance by the data sample, e.g. &lt;code&gt;var(y)&lt;/code&gt;, but since we’re on a log scale &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; is indeed pretty wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BFGS&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t seem as robust as some alternatives; (e.g. gives a rather different result than Nelder-Meade or &lt;code&gt;StructTS()&lt;/code&gt; model on the classic Nile data set example from the FKF package).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also challenging are the “50 random starting values”, which does not tell us from what distribution they were drawn. Too wide a distribution will start to include values for which the likelihood cannot be evaluated, while too narrow serves little purpose. –Moreover it is unclear if this is really preferable to simply using fewer starting points and a more robust algorithm. For simplicity, we’ll ignore this and just choose justifiable starting conditions.– we’ll add this as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four variants of the model defined by (1) and (2) were fitted to each data set; a full model with both uncertainty about population abundance and density dependence denoted by SSG (state space Gompertz), a model with uncertainty about population abundance, but no density dependence (c fixed to one) denoted SSRW (state space random walk), a model with density dependence, but no uncertainty about population abundance (r2 fixed to zero) denoted G (Gompertz) and a model with neither uncertainty about population abundance nor density dependence (c fixed to one and r2 fixed to zero) denoted RW (random walk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is both clear and straight forward, we define each of the models as described. Note that we define the models here in the notation of FKF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State transition equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[\alpha_{t+1} = d_t + T_t \alpha_t + H_t \eta_t\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[y_t = c_t + Z_t \alpha_t + G_t \eta_t\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which has the following correspondence with to the Gompertz model given before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
c &amp;amp;\to&amp;amp; T_t \\
a &amp;amp;\to&amp;amp; d_t \\
\sigma^2 &amp;amp;\to&amp;amp; G_t&amp;#39;G_t \\
\tau^2 &amp;amp;\to&amp;amp; H_t&amp;#39;H_t 
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we define these models in R code just as described above. Using the &lt;code&gt;FKF&lt;/code&gt; package we define each model by an optimization routine that returns the parameters that maximize the likelihood for the given model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;fkf&lt;/code&gt; will return finite (even “optimal”) log likelihoods for negative values of &lt;code&gt;HHt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GGt&lt;/code&gt;, so we have log-transformed these parameters. Using &lt;code&gt;L-BFGS-B&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; lower bound still causes &lt;code&gt;optim&lt;/code&gt; to error with non-finite log-likelihoods. It isn’t clear how the authors dealt with this constraint, though &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;-transform trick has advantages and drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have defined the optimization routines to fit each model, we can define a summary function that runs each model on a given data set and collects the results into a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;. This could be made a bit more general and elegant as discussed later. We will also define this function such that it will fit each model &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(N = 50\)&lt;/span&gt; times and take the best fit, as the authors suggest for having a better chance of finding the global optimum. (We’ll look at the variation in MLE estimates in these models as footnote as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having defined a function that takes and returns a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dplyr::do&lt;/code&gt; gives us a consise syntax to apply this by group (recall &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; is already &lt;code&gt;group_by(MainID)&lt;/code&gt;.) As the authors note, the robust fitting procedure is computationally intensive, though easily parallelized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;system.time&lt;/span&gt;(
df %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;kalman&lt;/span&gt;(., &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;method =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;BFGS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)) -&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;fits

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; does not as yet directly support parallelization (despite the documentation of &lt;code&gt;dplyr::init_cluster()&lt;/code&gt; describing parallel &lt;code&gt;dplyr::do()&lt;/code&gt; use, this feature is not actually implemented yet). Most parallelization packages for R wrap around &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; functions, and thus are not trivially adapted to the &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; grammar. If many cores are available it may still be faster to devolve the &lt;code&gt;group_by()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; into a list of data frames and then apply in parallel; e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# not run&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(parallel)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;mc.cores =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;detectCores&lt;/span&gt;())

## turn grouped data.frame to a list of data.frames by MainID

## Actually do the fitting in parallel

## reshape outputs back to a data.frame

&lt;p&gt;Likewise we can compute a version of Figure 1a; which calculates the absolute value of the difference between the estimates of density-dependence with and without the uncertainty, and then plots how frequently we observe a difference larger than a given amount in the data.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-note-on-coding-strategy&quot;&gt;Side note on coding strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; makes the data filtering steps fast, consise, and clear. Dealing with model outputs here is actually far less straight forward than cleaning the raw data. For instance, I have collected the output of each model fit into it’s own row. The models have different numbers of parameters, so I must add the fixed parameters to avoid rows of different length; but clearly this does not generalize to the case where the different models can have arbitrarily different parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dgrtwo&quot;&gt;David Robinson&lt;/a&gt; has done an excellent job in starting to tackle this thorny problem in a package called &lt;code&gt;broom&lt;/code&gt; with much the same elegance and care that Hadley has done with &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;. David argues very persuasively that it makes more sense to summarize parameter estimates from each model fit in two columns - a column for parameter names and a column for values. He has now added support for &lt;code&gt;optim()&lt;/code&gt; output to the &lt;code&gt;broom::tidy()&lt;/code&gt; function, which does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t translate immediately to my use case here, since I need to keep track of the likelihood and convergence which are not captured by &lt;code&gt;broom::tidy()&lt;/code&gt;. As these are scalar valued outputs of the model fit, instead of a vector like parameters, they are extracted and summarized in &lt;code&gt;broom::glance()&lt;/code&gt; as a single row. An easy generalization would just be to &lt;code&gt;cbind&lt;/code&gt; the outputs of &lt;code&gt;glance()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tidy()&lt;/code&gt;; though David argues for a different approach in which we defer any manipulation of model output. Instead, he suggests an &lt;code&gt;expand.grid&lt;/code&gt; over the names of the groups (models and datasets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;# not run&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;expand.grid&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;model =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;(models),
            &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;dataset =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;(datasets)) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;group_by&lt;/span&gt;(model, dataset) %&amp;gt;%
&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;o =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;optim_func&lt;/span&gt;(.$model, .$dataset)) -&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;david&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;optim_func&lt;/code&gt; uses the name of the model and name of the dataset to apply &lt;code&gt;optim()&lt;/code&gt;, rather than passing the data explicitly. We can then use &lt;code&gt;glance&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tidy&lt;/code&gt; on the resulting output, though we would need to &lt;code&gt;inner_join&lt;/code&gt; the results instead of &lt;code&gt;cbind&lt;/code&gt;. This is indeed an elegant, more generic approach. Still, neither of us much like the need to defer the tidy step to the complex object at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I have ended up adopting the column-wise parameter, value, approach, though for a reason not just related to elegance. My &lt;code&gt;robust_fit()&lt;/code&gt; error-handling seems to end up very occassionally with some kind of race conditions&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cause some of the sub-models to report an NA for one of their fixed parameters, instead of ommitting the parameter entirely. When adding the fixed value back in to keep rows of a uniform length, this meant I might get some rows with a duplicated column, such as a &lt;code&gt;GGt&lt;/code&gt; column with value &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; and another, appended column with the fixed value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rw&lt;/code&gt; models. The columnwise structure avoids this and prevents the code execution from failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could only ever reproduce this by re-running large batch jobs – isolating the examples where error occurred and re-running had no effect, hence my worry about some race conditions between the error reporting. However, the stochastic initial conditions might also contribute to this, as I didn’t standardize seed over the parallelization; though in priciple any unusual initial conditions should only generate fit failures that are already handled in the error handling.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;panel-on-effective-teaching-with-r&quot;&gt;Panel on Effective teaching with R&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracy Teal - Data Carpentry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hadley Wickhan - undergrads at Rice, R master classes for RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mine, Prof Stats, Duke, also MOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger Peng Prof Biostats, John Hopkins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenny Bryan, Prof Stats, UBC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Marwick, Prof Archaelogy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you engage new users? (Or what doesn’t work?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadley: Start with visualization. +1 Jenny Jenny: Making an HTML page with .Rmd (+1 Mine), scaling/aggregation Roger: these days, they come to me excited about R Mine: I have to convince social scientists to use computers at all. Visualization, faceting etc helps, Rmd helps.&lt;br /&gt;Ben: Reproducible scripts, not click trails (Excel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the worst way to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teaching data structures / programming first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teach loops, control structures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;later / no. Mine teaches loops with index cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hadley aims to to get people to re-invent lapply as a common pattern…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping people engaged? (Break-out session to develop reading lists, user groups)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mine data hack weekend. (PhD students mentoring, undergrads doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger: capstone project. Track alumni (via linked-in, other ideas?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracy: Pointing people to courses like Roger’s MOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging later-stage students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with own data and problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R’s horrible gotchas (recycling, NA stuff, factor stuff, dropping columns/names)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hadley: 1) set the expectations that R has frustrations. 2) room / chance to fail safely, how to debug (google error).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger: 10 examples of annoying things in R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenny: user str and fear factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben: getting help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger: students with programming experience need different kind of help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R &amp;amp; Github?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hadley, Mine – nope. Hadley - I didn’t commit to teaching it. Don’t try it at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger – it’s better (though students think git == github). Avoid why git is awesome, just teach it in a narrow sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenny – intensive use of Github whole time, starting with it up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben: not with undergrads, yes with grads. takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown, Github – if you’re gonna do it, commit and do everything in it from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadley: If something feels painful, do it more often. (git, R CMD check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing functions: need to learn eventually, but it’s really hard to teach. Hadley’s book exercises for the reader. Over time course gets simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When do you teach data cleaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny: a data-cleaning script itself cannot be clean. It’s an advanced topic I teach it midway.&lt;br /&gt;Jenny, Roger: includes teaching regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find outside dataset mid-way, sudo-messy data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadley: Hardest part is that students don’t know what the goal is, while I see it instantly. Takes a super long time to learn how to do this and to articulate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shouldn’t be too real, should be Disney-real (more real than reality). individual/personal they put in the time, so do a kaggle competition to clean data, top 3 winners get automatic A’s, opt out of final&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with spreadsheets and data entry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure for package building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;takes time, possibly &amp;gt; 30 min 1:1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mine: students run on cloud, I can replicate. but cannot run on own computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger: Better to live through the cli bs, once it’s done it’s done. VM’s not how the real world works. Hosting service for 1000s of people too expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenny: pain is only when we need build environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben: Use &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; Docker, replicates his own research. A slight taste of shell, but avoids CLI BS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;install challenges is the opposite of a motivator / win. Luckily doesn’t bite early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peer review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakouts / products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listing follow-up resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iris data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependencies &amp;amp; scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Docker distributes binaries of &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; for most major architectures ready-to-go, potentially making it easier to get started on Windows and Mac as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set credentials in environmental variables so we don’t have to pass them on the command line each time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt; = XXX&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and create the docker-machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size &amp;quot;1gb&amp;quot; server-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;server-name&lt;/code&gt; is any name you want to give your server and &lt;code&gt;DO_PAT&lt;/code&gt; is your access token (say, saved as an environmental variable). Here we launch a 1GB instance, the default is 512MB on digitalocean. Many other providers work just as well (including virtualbox). You need to set your terminal to use the active &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; for all &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; commands, instead of the local &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; env server-name&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sets three environmental variables that point your &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; commands to the new remote machine, &lt;code&gt;server-name&lt;/code&gt;. Wow. We can now launch any service of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=something rocker/hadleyverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it will run on the server. Get the IP address of the active machine with &lt;code&gt;docker-machine ip&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. open the server in the browser (from a Ubuntu-based client)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;xdg-open&lt;/span&gt; http://&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;`docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; ip&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;:8787&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re finished with the instance, we can destroy the machine so we will no longer be billed, using the same syntax as we would for a container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker-machine&lt;/span&gt; rm -f server-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a locally installed docker instance, we may also want to unset the environmental variables set by machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;DOCKER_CERT_PATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;unset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;DOCKER_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a list of active machines with &lt;code&gt;docker-machine ls&lt;/code&gt; and switch between machines with &lt;code&gt;docker-machine env&lt;/code&gt; as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spawning a new machine adds a bit more overhead than launching a container on an existing local or remote server instance, but not much; and is easily scripted. Of course the latency is higher too: the start-up time for the DO instance takes two minutes, and pulling a sizable image onto DO machine takes another two minutes or so. &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; actually prints the start-up time in seconds as it brings up the machine, in case you want to compare between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docker-compose&quot;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker compose is just fig, which is just a yaml config file / wrapper for (some of) the &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command-line options. As with &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt;, this simplicity is definitely a strength. Rather intuitively, &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; respects &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;, in that after setting the environmental variables as described above, &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; runs on the remote machine, just like &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docker-swarm&quot;&gt;Docker swarm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker swarm is rather analogous to CoreOS; it’s essential feature being a discovery service that allows the cluster to form. Swarm is mostly easily set up using docker-machine, though in my googling most tutorials fail to mention this. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/machine/#using-docker-machine-with-docker-swarm&quot;&gt;official docker-machine docs&lt;/a&gt; are probably the best reference on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker swarm provides rather limited functionality so far. A nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.docker.com/2015/02/scaling-docker-with-swarm/&quot;&gt;docker blog post on swarm&lt;/a&gt; In particular, it doesn’t yet support two key features found in CoreOS scheduling: fault-tolerant scheduling; which can move a container to another host if a machine goes down; nor does it yet support Master election; so the swarm breaks if the master goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It currently provides only relatively obvious scheduling – a bin-packing algorithm if you put constraints on resources a container can use, affinities to make sure &lt;code&gt;--link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--volumes-from&lt;/code&gt; and other such containers end up on the same instance. Instances can be annotated with labels that can be used as constraints, such as &lt;code&gt;storage=ssd&lt;/code&gt;, though it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/1002&quot;&gt;not clear&lt;/a&gt; how to add these from docker-machine. As long as swarm does not support fault-tolerant scheduling and master election though, these features are not as essential. Dynamically moving a container when a machine has failed means that no human is around to consider what resources the swarm has and where to schedule the container. But for merely adding a new container to an existing swarm, it’s not particularly hard for a human to look at the existing resources and just pick manually where to stick the container without the help of swarm’s algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm doesn’t really understand docker-compose yet either, in that compose is essentially written as a single-host tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can simulate parameters from the prior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Rmodel$l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Rmodel$l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 10.37676&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other nodes and likelihoods are updated to reflect the new value only after we run &lt;code&gt;calculate()&lt;/code&gt;, so this is the logProb of &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; originally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Rmodel$logProb_l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] NA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we run &lt;code&gt;calculate()&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;logProb&lt;/code&gt; is updated to reflect our simulated value of &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, as are the dependent terms (like the Sigma matrix)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Sigma &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rmodel$Sigma
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;calculate&lt;/span&gt;(Rmodel)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] -29.81744&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(Sigma, Rmodel$Sigma)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Rmodel$logProb_l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] -2.122469&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we don’t seem to be able to simulate actual data from the model in this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;Rmodel$y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] -2  0  1  2 -1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;simulate&lt;/span&gt;(Rmodel, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;y&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
Rmodel$y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] -2  0  1  2 -1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(Rmodel$y, Rmodel$origData[[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;y&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; remaines fixed to the original data values. We have to do this manually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mvrnorm&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;mu =&lt;/span&gt; constants$Mu, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;Sigma =&lt;/span&gt; Rmodel$Sigma) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1]  -7.498019 -20.999389   4.939137  11.751509  -8.123005&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Question-and-Answer-post on my use of Docker in research</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/02/24/docker-science-question-and-answer.html"/>
   <updated>2015-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/02/24/docker-science-question-and-answer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received an interesting email from an academic computing unit regarding the use of Docker in my research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been reading, listing, and prototyping best practices for building base images, achieving image composition, addressing interoperability, and standardizing on common APIs. When I read your paper, I thought you might have some opinions on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you be willing to share your experiences using Docker for research with our team? It doesn’t have to be a formal presentation. In fact, we generally prefer interactive conversations over slides, abstracts, etc. I appreciate that you must be terribly busy with your postdoc fellowship and rOpenScience responsibilities. If you’re not able to speak, perhaps you can answer a few questions about your use of Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick answers in reply; though like the questions themselves my replies are on the technical end and don’t give a useful overview of how I’m actually using Docker. Maybe that’s a subject for another post some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you currently still using Docker for your research? If so, how are you integrating that into your more demanding computational needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Docker helps me quickly provision and deploy a temporary compute environment on a cloud server with resources appropriate to the computation. This model much more accurately reflects the nature of computational research in a discipline such as ecology than does the standard HPC cluster model. My research typically involves many different tasks that can be easily separated and do not need the specialized architecture of a supercomputer, but do rely on a wide range of existing software tools and frequently also rely on internet connectivity for accessing certain data resources, etc. Because Docker makes it very easy for me to deploy customized software environments locally and on cloud computing resources, it facilitates my process of testing, scaling and distributing tasks to the appropriate computational resources quickly, while also increasing the portability &amp;amp; reproducibility of my work by colleagues who can benefit from the prebuilt environment provided by the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How/do you make use of data containers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely make use of data containers. I find they, and container orchestration more generally, are very well suited for deploying a service app (such as an API), but are less natural for composing scientific research environments which requires orchestrating volumes instead of tcp links. For instance, at present, there is no interface in &lt;code&gt;--volumes-from&lt;/code&gt; to mount the shared volume at a different mount point in the different container. Thus one cannot just link libraries from different containers with a &lt;code&gt;-v /usr/lib&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-v /usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;, as this would clobber the existing libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s rather a nuisance that on the current Debian/Ubuntu kernels at least, &lt;code&gt;docker rm&lt;/code&gt; does not fully clean up space from data containers (though we now have &lt;code&gt;docker rm -v&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you using to run your containers in production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production is a diverse notion in scientific research – from a software perspective scientific work is almost 100% development and 0% production. For containers running public, always-on services, I tend to run from a dedicated, appropriately resourced cloud server such as Digital Ocean. I don’t write such services very often (though we have been doing this to deploy public APIs for data recently), so this is the closest I get to ‘production’. I run my development environment and all my research code out of containers as well, both locally and on various cloud servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, I tend to run containers using the Docker CLI. I’ve found fig places larger resource requirements to run the same set of containers – so much so that it will fail to start on a machine that can run the containers fine from CLI or Fleet. fig also feels immature; it does not provide anything close to parity with the Docker CLI options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, while I find orchestration a powerful concept that is well suited for certain use-cases (our recent API uses five containers), for many academic research uses I find that orchestration is both unnecessary and a barrier to use. Orchestration works really well for professionally designed, web native, open source stack: our recent API deployment uses Redis, MySQL, NGINX, Sinatra, Unicorn, Logstash, ElasticSearch and Kibana – services that are all readily composed from official Docker containers into an existing application. Most scientific work looks nothing like this – the common elements tend to be shared libraries that are not well adapted to the same abstraction into separate services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you sharing them aside from the Docker Hub?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily through making the Dockerfiles available on Github. This makes it easy for others to build the images locally, and also fork and modify the Dockerfile directly. I maintain a private Docker registry as well but rarely have need for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have practical experience and advice about achieving real portability with Docker across hosting environments (ie. stick with X as an OS, use a sidekick and data container for data backups and snapshotting, etc)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall this hasn’t been much of an issue. Sharing volumes with the host machine on hosts that require virtualization/boot2docker was an early problem, though this has been much better since Docker 1.3. In a similar vein, getting &lt;code&gt;boot2docker&lt;/code&gt; running on older hardware can be problematic. And of course docker isn’t really compatible with 32 bit machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time with CoreOS, I tend to use Ubuntu machines when running in the cloud: ‘highly available’ isn’t much of a priority in the research context, where few things are at a scale where hardware failure is an issue. I found CoreOS worked poorly on individual machines or cluster sizes that might shrink below 2; while the new OS model was a barrier to entry for myself and for collaborators. I suspect this situation will improve dramatically as these tools gain polish and abstraction that requires less manual tooling for common patterns (I find that ambassador containers, sidekick containers, etc place too many OS-level tasks on the shoulders of the user). Of course there is a large ecosystem of solutions in this space, which also needs time to harden into standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my comments re: CLI vs fig in Q3 are also relevant here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the computational requirements of your research codes outgrown a physical node?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at the present. I’ve run prior work on clusters on a campus and at the DOE’s Carver machine at NERSC, though at this time I can almost always meet computational needs with the larger single instances of a service like EC2 or DigitalOcean. Much more often I have the need to run many different codes (sometimes related things that could be parallelized in a single command but are better off distributed, but much more often unrelated tasks) at the same time. Being able to deploy these in isolated, pre-provisioned environments on one or multiple machines using Docker has thus been a huge gain in both my efficiency and realized computational performance. If any particular task becomes too intensive, Docker makes it very easy to move over to a new cloud instance with more resources that will not interfere with other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a workflow for versioning and releasing images comparable to GitFlow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, though maybe this would be a good idea. I work almost exclusively with automated builds and hardly ever use &lt;code&gt;docker commit&lt;/code&gt;. Though the Dockerfiles themselves are versioned, obviously the software that is installed between different automated builds can differ substantially, and there is in general no way to recover an earlier build. Using a &lt;code&gt;docker commit&lt;/code&gt; workflow instead would provide this more versioned history and greater stability of the precise binaries installed, but also feels more like a black box as the whole thing cannot then be reproduced from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you version your Dockerfile/image/source code separately?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I version all my Dockerfiles with git. I version my images as needed but more rarely, and in a way that reflects the version of the predominant software they install (e.g. r-base:3.1.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you prefer using the entrypoint or command to run your containers by default?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer command (&lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt;), as it is more semantic, easier to alter the default and can take longer strings (no need for a flag).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dai Model</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/02/12/dai-model.html"/>
   <updated>2015-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/02/12/dai-model</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-first-go-at-implementing-the-dai-et-al-model&quot;&gt;A first go at implementing the Dai et al model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the supplement to &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1219805&quot;&gt;10.1126/science.1219805&lt;/a&gt;, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[n_{t+1} = n_t g(n_t + \epsilon n_t, \theta)\]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[g(n_t) = \frac{n_{t+1}}{n_t}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is based on two phases of daily growth: a slow exponential growth phase at low cell densities, followed by a logistic growth phase with a higher per capita growth rate at intermediate cell densities. This model has 5 parameters: T lag is the lag time before yeast cells start to grow after being transferred into new media (the total time for daily growth is 23 hours). In the slow exponential phase, the population grows with a constant per capita growth rate γ low . After the population reaches a threshold density N c , the subsequent logistic growth is determined by γ high (γ high &amp;gt;γ low ) and the carrying capacity K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt} = 
    \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \gamma_{\textrm{low}} &amp;amp; N &amp;lt; N_c \\
        \gamma_{\textrm{high}} \left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) &amp;amp;  N_c &amp;lt;= N &amp;lt; K 
      \end{array}
    \right.\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit surprised by the model formulation here, particularly that a threshold response is built in at a critical density &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(N_c\)&lt;/span&gt;. Seems like this could emerge by explicitly modeling the positive density dependence due to the cooperative break-down of sugar, which should result in a smoother dependence between growth and density. A discontinuous growth model isn’t particularly satisfying as and cannot arise very directly from an individual-based description. Anyway, onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, a bit of work is needed before we can simulate this from the description. Integrating this over time gives us exponential growth below &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(N_c\)&lt;/span&gt; and something Beverton-Holt-esque above &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(N_c\)&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODE we can integrate analytically, &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[x_t = K \exp(r t + K c_1) / (\exp(r t + K c_1) - 1)\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And solve for the constant if integration using the initial condition,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align*} 
&amp;amp; N_0 =  K \exp( K c_1) / (\exp( K c_1) - 1) \\
&amp;amp; N_0 (\exp( K c_1) - 1) =  K \exp( K c_1) \\
&amp;amp; K \exp( K c_1) - N_0 \exp( K c_1) + N_0 = 0 \\
&amp;amp; \exp( K c_1)( K  - N_0) + N_0 = 0 \\
&amp;amp; \exp(K c_1) = N_0 / (K - N_0) \\
&amp;amp; \exp(K c_1) = 1/(K/N_0 - 1) =: B
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So substituting for the IC we have,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\[\begin{align*} 
x_t &amp;amp; = K B \exp(r t )  / (B \exp(r t) - 1) \\

   <title>Fun Standardizing Non Standard Evaluation</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/02/06/fun-standardizing-non-standard-evaluation.html"/>
   <updated>2015-02-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/02/06/fun-standardizing-non-standard-evaluation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; calls on the back-end of the &lt;code&gt;rfishbase&lt;/code&gt; re-write means working around the non-standard evaluation (NSE), as described in the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the data I was using for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
downloader::&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://github.com/cboettig/2015/raw/fc0d9185659e7976927d0ec91981912537ac6018/assets/data/2015-02-06-taxa.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;taxa.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
all_taxa &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;read.csv&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;taxa.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a simple NSE &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;x &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;(all_taxa, Family ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;#39;Scaridae&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best SE version of this just needs to use the formula expression, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; SE version of the function and it’s &lt;code&gt;.dots&lt;/code&gt; argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;.dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(~Family ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;#39;Scaridae&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
x1 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter_&lt;/span&gt;(all_taxa, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.dots=&lt;/span&gt;.dots)

&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(x, x1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets us treat the arguments (e.g. values of the factor on which we filter) as variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;family &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;#39;Scaridae&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
.dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(~Family ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;family)
x2 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter_&lt;/span&gt;(all_taxa, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.dots=&lt;/span&gt;.dots)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(x, x2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want both the key and value to vary, we need to get pretty fancy to subvert the non-standard evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;(lazyeval)
family &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;#39;Scaridae&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
field &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &amp;#39;Family&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
.dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;interp&lt;/span&gt;(~y ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;x, 
                     &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.values =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;y =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;as.name&lt;/span&gt;(field), &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; family)))
x3 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter_&lt;/span&gt;(all_taxa, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.dots=&lt;/span&gt;.dots)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(x, x3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At bit more fun to wrap this into a function where we take arbitrary number of arguments as name-value pairs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;query &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;Family =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Scaridae&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;SpecCode =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;5537&lt;/span&gt;)
dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;lapply&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;(query), function(level){
    value &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;query[[level]]
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;interp&lt;/span&gt;(~y ==&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;x, 
                &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.values =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;y =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;as.name&lt;/span&gt;(level), &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; value))
  })
  
x3 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;filter_&lt;/span&gt;(all_taxa, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.dots =&lt;/span&gt; dots) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-fun-standardizing-nse&quot;&gt;More fun standardizing NSE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous examples show only applications to &lt;code&gt;filter_()&lt;/code&gt;. While the general idea is the same, this pattern doesn’t translate directly for other functions, such as &lt;code&gt;mutate_&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s some common patterns I’ve adopted when using &lt;code&gt;mutate_()&lt;/code&gt;. First consider the familiar NSE useage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;df &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;(mtcars, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;displ_l =&lt;/span&gt; disp /&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;61.0237&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;(df)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb  displ_l
1 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4 2.621932
2 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4 2.621932
3 22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1 1.769804
4 21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1 4.227866
5 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2 5.899347
6 18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1 3.687092&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we use &lt;code&gt;list(interp(&lt;/code&gt; pattern, but note that we specify the name for our new column using &lt;code&gt;setNames&lt;/code&gt; (naming the elements of the list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;dots &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;setNames&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;(lazyeval::&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;interp&lt;/span&gt;(~x /&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;y, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;(disp), &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;y=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fl&quot;&gt;61.0237&lt;/span&gt;)), &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;displ_l&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
df2 &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mutate_&lt;/span&gt;(mtcars, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;.dots =&lt;/span&gt; dots)
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;identical&lt;/span&gt;(df, df2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the use &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; could be skipped for a more direct value if that was not a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-dplyr-patterns&quot;&gt;More &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also thought I would scribble down some other common &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; patterns I find myself re-using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applying a function that returns a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; to each element of a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and coercing the combined output to a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;mylist %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;lapply&lt;/span&gt;(myfun) %&amp;gt;%&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dplyr::&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;bind_rows&lt;/span&gt;() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To place this deeper in the &lt;code&gt;hadleyverse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;purrr::map&lt;/code&gt; could be dropped in for &lt;code&gt;lapply&lt;/code&gt; in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common pattern for me is &lt;code&gt;expand.grid() %&amp;gt;% group_by() %&amp;gt;% do()&lt;/code&gt;, Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/3f42aa4623f40cee70d5a9d52a8cce73617248a5/inst/scripts/table.Rmd&quot;&gt;recent example of mine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also includes an example of how to define &lt;code&gt;group_by_all()&lt;/code&gt; since that is usually the grouping I need from an &lt;code&gt;expand.grid()&lt;/code&gt; call (that is, I want to apply over all combinations of some parameter settings, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hope is not a common pattern but one I struggled with for a bit: making recursive calls of the above pattern for nested lists. This code in RNeXML illustrates my solution, which required both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/blob/b596839e3a1fc53e74b46fd935d91dca59a9da98/R/get_metadata.R#L50-L59&quot;&gt;function recursion and function closure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dockerizing Fishbase Api</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/02/03/dockerizing-fishbase-api.html"/>
   <updated>2015-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/02/03/dockerizing-fishbase-api</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;dockerized-mysql-background&quot;&gt;Dockerized MySQL background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out using an external MySQL docker container for the in-development fishbase API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d mysql
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run --rm -ti --link some-mysql:mysql ubuntu:latest bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re inside the ubuntu container we can see linked environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;HOSTNAME=57fd2b08094a
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
TERM=xterm
MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT=3306
MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.32:3306
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
PWD=/
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_VERSION=5.6.22
SHLVL=1
HOME=/root
MYSQL_NAME=/some-app/mysql
MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PROTO=tcp
MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.32
LESSOPEN=| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_MAJOR=5.6
MYSQL_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.32:3306
LESSCLOSE=/usr/bin/lesspipe %s %s
_=/usr/bin/env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. Now we need a mysql client to access the host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; update &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install -y mysql-client-core-5.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we cannot simply do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt; --password=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which gives the error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can&amp;#39;t connect to local MySQL server through socket &amp;#39;/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock&amp;#39; (2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we must also specify the protocol and port of the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt; --host=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR&lt;/span&gt; --protocol=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PROTO&lt;/span&gt; --password=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; It’s much better to use the hostname provided by the linked container in &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. This automatically binds the name used in the link &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; to the linked container’s IP address, so we can simply do: &lt;code&gt;mysql =--host=mysql --password=$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; (protocol, like the port, is guessed implicitly from host). Unlike the env var solution, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file is updated if the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; container restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we’re good to go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-this-in-fishbaseapi&quot;&gt;Applying this in fishbaseapi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott has put together a nice start to the fishbase API built on Ruby’s &lt;code&gt;sinatra&lt;/code&gt; gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step is to import the SQL database archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our database to persist even if our container is destroyed, we link it to a local volume. So we start a &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; container with a local volume link, e.g. to &lt;code&gt;/opt/fishbase/data&lt;/code&gt; on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; mkdir -p /opt/fishbase/data
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -v /opt/fishbase/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now need to import the data from the &lt;code&gt;fbapp.sql&lt;/code&gt; file as a one-off event. We’ll use a temporary &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; container to do this, linked to the persistent image we just launched. For this container, we’ll start a bash container that is linked to the &lt;code&gt;fbapp.sql&lt;/code&gt; file directly (note that docker volume linking works for files too):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run --rm -ti --link mysql:mysql -v /path/to/fbapp.sql:/data/fbapp.sql -w /data mysql bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drops us into a bash session on the container where we can launch a linked &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; session and import our tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt; --host=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR&lt;/span&gt; --protocol=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PROTO&lt;/span&gt; --password=&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt; fbapp &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; fbapp.sql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: if this gives us an error about being unable to write the table, we may need to adjust the permissions of the linked file appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -ti mysql bash
chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, the database is set up and ready to be linked to our app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dockerizing-the-sinatra-app&quot;&gt;Dockerizing the Sinatra app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight-forward, noting only that we need to again use the environmental variables shown for the &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; credentials inside our ruby script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode ruby&quot;&gt;  client = &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;Mysql2&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;.new(&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;], 
                             &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;:port&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;], 
                             &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;],
                             &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;:username&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, 
                             &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;:database&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;fbapp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that we need to execute our ruby app with host &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; instead of the default &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; so that the port will be accessible outside the docker container, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/span&gt; api.rb -o 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could get away with just a 2-line Dockerfile using the &lt;code&gt;onbuild&lt;/code&gt; flavor of the official Ruby containers, which has rather clever triggers for installing dependencies listed in the Gemfile when the image is built, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ruby/&quot;&gt;DockerHub/ruby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since one still needs to build a new Docker image either way, I’ve opted for a slightly more explicit (and smaller) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/master/Dockerfile&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/a&gt; based on Debian instead. This installs the ruby dependencies (including gems and associated libraries, which would all have been automated by the Ruby Dockerfile), and sets up a default run command to launch the app running the sinatra API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just run this container linked to the database and we’re good to go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; run -d -p 4567:4567 --link mysql:mysql ropensci/rfishbase&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally a way to run generic docker images on free CI: &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/docs/docker&quot;&gt;circle-ci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding private keys to Travis requires too much of a dance (encrypting credentials into &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;; on Circle-CI, like Drone, these can just be configured through the Circle-CI web interface. Travis has no way to restart a stochastically failed build without another commit, doesn’t display the logs in a convenient summary, and doesn’t support deploying as first-class configuration step (though easy enough to hack it of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;machine:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;services:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker

&lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;dependencies:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;override:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker info
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker build -t circleci/elasticsearch .

&lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;test:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;override:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fu&quot;&gt;docker run -d -p 9200:&lt;/span&gt;9200 circleci/elasticsearch; sleep 10

&lt;p&gt;We propose a state model consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;http://10.2139/ssrn.421007&quot;&gt;10.2139/ssrn.421007&lt;/a&gt;; in this case a simple Beverton-Holt model. Note that in defining &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;\(f\)&lt;/span&gt; we have assumed the harvesting take place before the population recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than explicitly modeling the trend element predicted by the linearization, let us simply remove it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode r&quot;&gt;N &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;(raw$x)

data &amp;lt;-&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;data.frame&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;x =&lt;/span&gt; detrend$residuals/&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;(detrend$residuals)))
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;qplot&lt;/span&gt;(raw$t, data$x, &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;geom=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;line&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Automated Knitr In Jekyll</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/07/automated-knitr-in-jekyll.html"/>
   <updated>2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/01/07/automated-knitr-in-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;combining-knitr-jeykll-using-servr&quot;&gt;Combining knitr &amp;amp; jeykll using &lt;code&gt;servr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yihui Xie, author &amp;amp; maintainer of &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt;, has a nice little package out called &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/yihui/servr&quot;&gt;servr&lt;/a&gt; for serving websites from R. It includes a handy &lt;code&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt; function which streamlines the process of first running &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; on any &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; posts before running Jekyll. Having broken my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html&quot;&gt;notebook into volumes&lt;/a&gt;, my setup is now ready to take advantage of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuring-knitr-with-the-build.r-script&quot;&gt;Configuring &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;build.R&lt;/code&gt; script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R build process can be tuned using a custom &lt;code&gt;build.R&lt;/code&gt; script. In particular, it can be useful to set up some default knitr package and chunk options such as how to handle caching, figures, and messages. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cboettig/2015/blob/4ce767965a0015ca2890023aa6adfb1109b6f94c/_build.R&quot;&gt;my build.R script&lt;/a&gt; at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caching: By turning caching on I avoid having to make the server re-run all the unchanged R code from scratch each time. I simply point the cache to a directory, &lt;code&gt;_cache&lt;/code&gt; in the repository root that is ignored both by git and jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures: I’m still not completely decided how to best to handle figures. Two questions in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m undecided if it is better to embed them in the html (as data uris or embedded svg) or link as external files? Embedding avoids the risk of broken paths to the images, and means we can view the history of the file by rendering the committed html with sites like &lt;code&gt;http://rawgit.com/&lt;/code&gt;. Perhaps for the reasons it seems to be the default setting in RStudio’s &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown::render&lt;/code&gt;. On the other hand it makes it harder to diff the images themselves when they aren’t committed as stand-alone files. Note that never need to commit the figures to the source branch, or commit the intermediate &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file produced by &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt;, thus embedding data URI’s isn’t so cumbersome (i.e. doesn’t create cumbersome markdown, though it makes the HTML even less readable). I’ve currently configured this to handle both cases, though some care must be taken in setting the paths correctly (e.g. &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt;) if images are only linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other question is whether to rely on png or svg images. svg images tend to look better and can result in very small file sizes for certain plots, but can also get much too large on others. svg files are text based and so play nicely with git, whether they are embedded in the HTML or linked externally. Meanwhile, pngs can be diff’d by Github now, and provide more reliable file sizes even on plots with tons of points, so I am using them as the default setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;automated-deploy-with-drone&quot;&gt;Automated deploy with Drone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice feature of jekyll has always been the ability for Github to build the pages automatically whenever changes to the source files are pushed to the repository. Since Github’s jekyll doesn’t support plugins such as the one needed to use pandoc as a markdown parser, I have long worked around this using travis CI to run jekyll with pandoc installed. Unfortunately, adding knitr to the mix is too much for travis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The R commands of any or all posts may exceed the 50 minute max build time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other difficulties also arise for travis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we would need to install the complete R environment, pandoc, and the complete jekyll+ruby gems environment necessary to build the site (also within the 50 minute time, unless these could be cached externally too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we couldn’t easily store the knitr cache (would have to push and pull this from some remote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we have to encrypt the credentials to push to Github, use the twitter API, etc (on a per-repository basis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest alternative is simply to build the site locally. While this is always a viable option and often preferable (one will usually want to run the script interactively before committing anyway), it precludes the ability to make changes from the online interface or a tablet where the resources to run the code are not immediately available. Having automated build is much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a Drone instance on a personal server is much more appealing. I already have a small DigitalOcean instance at the moment which runs a variety of services, including Drone. Advantages include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having drone on a personal server means I can use &lt;em&gt;custom docker images&lt;/em&gt;. In thiw way, I can provide an image with all or most of the software I need already installed. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hub.docker.com/u/cboettig/labnotebook&quot;&gt;Dockerfile for cboettig/labnotebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging into the Drone instance (secured with a Github application handshake), I can add private environmental variables for credentials and keys without the need to go through the encryption dance on travis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running on my own server, Drone keeps a library of docker images (no need to pull each time). Because this image is not automatically pulled a-fresh on each commit, the build is faster and I have more control over when the software environment is updated (which always carries the potential of breaking things).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the R scripts, the build time can be further speed up by configuring to cache selected files such that the knitr cache and generated figures are available to future builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;caching-knitr-files&quot;&gt;Caching knitr files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/cboettig/2015/tree/master/.drone.yml&quot;&gt;.drone.yml&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of my configuration. Most of the script is concerned with setting up the caching appropriately, which isn’t yet as streamlined as it might be (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/drone/drone/issues/147&quot;&gt;drone/147&lt;/a&gt;). The deploy script must also do a bit of a dance to build the site on the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch but push the contents of &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. Perhaps these can be improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-docker-image-for-the-labnotebook&quot;&gt;A docker image for the labnotebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a docker image with all the software needed to build the notebook also goes a long way to making the notebook more portable. The labnotebook docker images could further be versioned with tags matching the year, such that &lt;code&gt;cboettig/labnotebook:2015&lt;/code&gt; corresponded to a Dockerfile with software environment specific to building the repository. Because such an image contains most of the software I use regularly, it also provides something of a swiss-army knife for common tasks (on any machine where docker is available):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An R shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data R &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandoc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jekyll server: (Note that running jekyll or servr from within docker requires changing the default host from &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -d -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/data jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data bash &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;latex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd):/data pdflatex file.tex &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RStudio server (note the &lt;code&gt;-u 0&lt;/code&gt; to launch server as root):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -u 0 -v $(pwd):/data supervisord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Lsn Model Considerations</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Should we model the change in mean explicitly, or rely on detrending?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things to deal with in the model setup is whether we ‘detrend’ the data first or not. As you know, in most saddle-node bifurcations the mean also moves since the stable node usually moves a bit to collide with the unstable node rather than just sitting there and waiting for the unstable node to hit it; which results in a gradual decrease of the mean prior to the actual catastrophe. It’s relatively typical to detrend any changes in the mean out (after all, sometimes this will also reflect things like seasonal variation etc., so it’s not a trivial thing to build into the model in a general way). Modeling the rate of change in mean makes it possible for a mean-only change to be sufficient to prefer the model of change over the OU model… However, detrending needs rigorous definition to justify the approach. Transforming the data can distort the signal (particularly obvious with the case of interpolation). I don’t really like detrending since it can be rather arbitrary in how you choose to go about it, but I suppose it’s preferable to specific modeling assumptions that try and capture the trend as well. There’s an interesting comparison of detrending with just a Gaussian filter vs using the exact model in this paper really nice paper on warning signals in epidemiology that I’ve only recently come across; which also does some elegant van Kampen expansions en route: http://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-013-0185-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
Consider the mean changes as a function $f(x(t),t)$, we would want an approach that claims to provide a non-parametric estimate of $f$ such that for our data, $x - f(x)$ approximates to the model we fit (e.g. OU model with time-dependent spring constant term alone).

   <title>Notes</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/05/notes.html"/>
   <updated>2015-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/01/05/notes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-user-craziness-with-docker&quot;&gt;more user craziness with docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should do something about rstudio script when running as a non-root user…. Fixed! Requires changing user more carefully; we cannot simply delete the existing user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using a docker image with a non-root default user, we can launch a container as root by giving root’s UID instead with the &lt;code&gt;--user 0&lt;/code&gt; flag. (Note that we can do this with other UIDs as well, though it produces a troublesome unnamed user when the userid hasn’t been assigned to a user name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RStudio image now completely configures default user in the Dockerfile, such that userconf.sh need only configure custom users. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/blob/cec3912d3bc40352fc4ca7d7d281db9e25b3dd86/rstudio/userconf.sh&quot;&gt;userconf.sh&lt;/a&gt;. We now do:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;usermod -l rstudio docker \
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; usermod -m -d /home/rstudio rstudio \
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; groupmod -n rstudio docker &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of &lt;code&gt;userdel&lt;/code&gt; which causes issues if we launch as that user. Note, this means containers built on &lt;code&gt;rstudio&lt;/code&gt; have only the user &lt;code&gt;rstudio&lt;/code&gt; available and not the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; user, unless explicitly added/renamed. Avoids issues like multiple home directories/unpredictable home directory name as well (Since RStudio-server wants to open in home dir and not in a user-owned root directory like &lt;code&gt;/data&lt;/code&gt; like most other apps would use.) - RStudio must still be launched as root (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.rstudio.com/hc/communities/public/questions/200661923-Does-Rstudio-have-to-run-as-root-&quot;&gt;RStudio issue&lt;/a&gt;), so a Dockerfile with non-root user must use the &lt;code&gt;--user 0&lt;/code&gt; flag or run &lt;code&gt;rserver&lt;/code&gt; or the default &lt;code&gt;supervisord&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;- Configure &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/blob/cec3912d3bc40352fc4ca7d7d281db9e25b3dd86/rstudio/supervisord.conf&quot;&gt;supervisord.conf&lt;/a&gt; configuration not to throw erroneous error messages (e.g. &lt;code&gt;userconf.sh&lt;/code&gt; is expected to exit with 0, users explicitly declared, config file explicitly declared to avoid security vulnerability of custom conf in working dir, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notebook Maintenance And Scaling</title>
   <link href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html"/>
   <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Electronic notebooks may not run out of pages like a paper notebook, but with five years of entries (963 posts, with a repository size approaching half a gigabyte), together with various files, layouts, experimentation and version history, some thought must be given to scale. Two closely related considerations add to this further: dynamic builds with &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; versions and hosting image files directly in the notebook repository rather than uploading to an external site (previously flickr or on the gh-pages of other project repositories). This has several advantages (more on that later) but in the immediate term it makes building the repository potentially slower (though knitr’s caching helps) and increases the repository size more rapidly (even with text-based &lt;code&gt;svg&lt;/code&gt; images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Jekyll system keeps all posts in a single repository and rebuilds the HTML files for each every time. This is already showing some strains: for instance, for some reason the git hashes when generating the site automatically on Travis cease updating for older posts, though this problem doesn’t occur when building locally. Overall, the Jekyll platform is rather snappy so this isn’t an unmanageable size, but is sufficient to demonstrate that the approach isn’t able to scale indefinitely either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as with the paper notebook whose pages are filled, it’s time to crack open a new binding and shelve the old notebooks – somewhere handy to be sure, but no longer one voluminous tome on the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/2015/assets/figures/posts/2015-01-01/notebooks-shelf.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-multi-repository-approach&quot;&gt;A multi-repository approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, I’m am trying out breaking the notebook over multiple repositories: using a new repository for each year’s worth of entries, and an additional repository to provide the basic pages (&lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;teaching&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vita&lt;/code&gt;, etc. from the navbar) along with the assets used by all the other sites (css, fonts, javascript, etc). This avoids rebuilding the posts of notebooks from all previous years every time the Jekyll site is compiled, keeping the repositories smaller, the site more modular and more easy to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises some challenges such as keeping the layout and appearance consistent without maintaining copies of layout files across multiple repositories; managing URLs and paths across different repositories, and aggregating metadata (posts, tags, categories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;repos-paths-and-urls-for-the-multi-notebook&quot;&gt;Repos, Paths, and URLs for the multi-notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the source files (such as &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; entries, templates, etc.) in different repositories it would be simple enough to combine the generated HTML files from each repository into a single output directory serving the site (on Github or elsewhere). However, GitHub’s &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; provide an elegantly more modular way to do this already. GitHub uses the URL of the user’s repository (the repo named &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, which also serves as the site URL unless a different domain is specified using a CNAME file) as the root domain for all other &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branches on the Github repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I have created repositories named &lt;code&gt;2015&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2014&lt;/code&gt;, etc, which will serve the notebooks for the corresponding year from their own &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch. Moving my &lt;code&gt;www.carlboettiger.info&lt;/code&gt; (the use of a subdomain such as &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; is required in order to benefit from Github’s CDN, though if it is omitted the domain provider will add it) from my &lt;code&gt;labnotebook&lt;/code&gt; repo to my &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository means that the annual repositories now have base URLs such as &lt;code&gt;www.carlboettiger.info/2015&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;www.carlboettiger.info/2014&lt;/code&gt;. Adjusting the &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; to omit &lt;code&gt;/year:&lt;/code&gt; from the permalink, since it is already in the base URL, is all that is needed to ensure that the posts of all my old URLs will still resolve to the same pages. Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the site pages is more tricky than dealing with the posts. Pages come in two variates: some, like &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;research.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vita.html&lt;/code&gt;, contain only content that is independent of whatever is in the notebook pages and thus can live quite happily in the &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository. Others, like &lt;code&gt;tags.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;categories.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;archive.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lab-notebook.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;atom.xml&lt;/code&gt; and other tag-specific RSS feeds are dynamically generated by Jekyll using the metadata of the posts, and thus need to live in the individual notebook repositories instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This instead of just having the page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/tags&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/tags&lt;/a&gt;, each year begins a new notebook with it’s own tags, categories, etc: &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/2014/tags&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/2014/tags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/2013/tags&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/2013/tags&lt;/a&gt;. For tags, categories,it makes some sense to have this information aggregated by year, avoiding the clutter of too many or too stale tags or categories (though perhaps something is lost by not being able to see this in aggregate across all years, at least not without some effort). Likewise for the list of posts by date (previously at &lt;code&gt;archive.html&lt;/code&gt;, now just turned into &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;) is produced for each annual notebook, such that &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/2014&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/2014&lt;/a&gt; resolves a reverse-chronological list of posts for that year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must then address what to do about the original URLs such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/tags&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/tags&lt;/a&gt;. Using a Jekyll liquid filter it is easy to define automatic redirects for &lt;code&gt;/tags.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/categories.html&lt;/code&gt; that will forward to the current year’s tag’s and categories, though perhaps an aggregated view would be preferable. For &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/archive&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/archive&lt;/a&gt; I have provided manual links to the index of each annual notebook rather than a redirect to the index of only the most current notebook. Likewise for one of my most popular pages, &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook&lt;/a&gt;, I have retained the automated feeds from Github, Twitter, and Mendeley, but replaced the previews of the most recent posts with the less aesthetic link to the notebook by year. Meanwhile, I have provided each notebook with it’s own nine-panel preview page such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://carlboettiger.info/2014/lab-notebook&quot;&gt;carlboettiger.info/2014/lab-notebook&lt;/a&gt;, which has the preview but not the network feeds (Perhaps it would be better to move this to the index page). In this way, the social feeds can be updated merely by updating the &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo (since these are rendered as static text rather than javascript, written using the relevant API at the time the site is built.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more tricky case is that of the atom feeds. It doesn’t really make sense to subscribe to a &lt;code&gt;carlboettiger.info/2015/blog.xml&lt;/code&gt; feed that will be inactive in a year. Using HTML redirects in a &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; file doesn’t make too much sense, so I will try the RSS-flavor redirect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;newLocation&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/blog.xml
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/newLocation&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though this seems less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;automated-deploy&quot;&gt;Automated deploy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I use the &lt;code&gt;jeykll-pandoc&lt;/code&gt; gem to have pandoc render the markdown, along with a few other custom plugins, I cannot take advantage of Github’s automated build for Jekyll and have instead relied on the trick of having Travis-CI build and deploy the site. Adding automated knitr building to the mix will make this too heavy for travis, even for more modular notebooks. Instead, I am relying on local building, together with automated builds from my own server running a Drone CI instance. More on this in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-assets-templates&quot;&gt;Site assets, templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual notebook repositories are thus much more light-weight. All css assets are in the root &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository or already provided by external CDNs (such as the FontAwesome icons or MathJax, and Bootstrap javascript). However, it is necessary that both all annual notebook repositories and the base repo have the Jekyll &lt;code&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; files required to template and build the pages. This is unfortunate, since it means maintaining multiple copies of the same file, but I haven’t figured out an easy way around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pruning-history&quot;&gt;Pruning history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In breaking &lt;code&gt;labnotebook&lt;/code&gt; into component repos by year, I only want to preserve the history of that year, thus keeping the repositories small. This is particularly important for the root repo, &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, since it will remain active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;edit &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; to remove &lt;code&gt;/:year&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; (the repository name will automatically be used as part of the URL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete all posts from different years (preferable to just wait until deleting their history, which will remove the files as well), e.g. for 2014:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;files=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;`echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dt&quot;&gt;{_posts/2008-*,_posts/2009-*,_posts/2010-*,_posts/2011-*,_posts/2012-*,_posts/2013-*}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; filter-branch --index-filter &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ot&quot;&gt;$files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; HEAD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and remove the temporary backups immediately so that repository actually shrinks in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git update-ref -d refs/original/refs/heads/master
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more important in the root repository, since this will remain active. If the annual notebook entry repositories have some extra stuff in their &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; history it isn’t such an issue since they no longer need to grow or be moved around as much. (See this &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2100907&quot;&gt;SO on rewriting git history&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-progress-notes-during-the-remapping&quot;&gt;My progress notes during the remapping:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] delete the CNAME file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] delete all the relatively static pages files that will be hosted directly from &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;research.md&lt;/code&gt;, etc., but not dynamically created &lt;code&gt;tags.html&lt;/code&gt; etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] adjust &lt;code&gt;repo:&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; to match the repository year. This will automatically fix the sha and history links in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Other tweaks to the sidebar: &lt;code&gt;site.repo&lt;/code&gt; liquid must be added to categories, tags, next, and previous links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Automated deploy for active and root repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Plan for &lt;code&gt;labnotebook&lt;/code&gt; repo. History is preserved, but issues, github stars, etc. Use as template for the new years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Activate! Remove CNAME from &lt;code&gt;labnotebook&lt;/code&gt; repo, add &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; CNAME to &lt;code&gt;cboettig.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. Consider removing &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch of lab-notebook?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Fix / workaround for the root atom feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[x] Syncing assets, layout, and deploy scripts? Perhaps it is best to allow these to diverge and newer notebooks to look different than older ones?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
