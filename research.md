I'm a theorist working a variety of problems in ecology and evolution centered around the phenomenon of regime shifts.  Can we detect sudden ecological crashes before they happen? Can we detect major evolutionary shifts using phylogenetic trees?  I draw on a combination of theory, modeling, and statistical inference to build new insights, methods and software to address such questions.   I aim to develop statistical inference methods that will not only give us the best answer given the available data, but an honest picture of the uncertainty that comes with it, and explore how knowledge of that uncertainty can best influence the decisions we make. Detecting regime shifts in any data is a problem of searching for a weak signal in a lot of noise, and this requires very large data sets.  Large data is coming of age in ecology, yet this introduces not only computational but also social challenges of assembly and access.


I draw on an education in physics and a training fellowship in computational science as well as close collaborations with other researchers.  My evolutionary research has been in concert with the <a href="http://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/">Wainwright lab</a>.   As a theorist I try to maintain not only a close contact with empirical researchers but exposure to the rigors and uncertainty of field research whenever I can.  I'm very grateful to colleagues who have taken me along to help on trips such as monitoring salamander pitfall traps along vernal ponds and excavating an icthyosaur fossil in the Nevada desert.
