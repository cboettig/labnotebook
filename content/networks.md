title: Networks

---


Below are a few links to my more commonly used social network profiles and Internet habitats, along with a few comments.  I am pretty consistently found under the user handle `cboettig` on social networks, though no guarantees.

## Actively Using 

* __[<i class = "fa fa-github"></i> ](http://github.com/cboettig)__ -- The web-based home of my research.  Star, watch, or fork a project you're interested in.
* __[<i class = "fa fa-twitter"></i> ](http://twitter.com/cboettig)__ -- My primary social network, which is why it gets a contact link in my footer.
* __[<i class = "fa fa-stack-overflow"></i> ](http://stackoverflow.com/users/258662/carl)__ -- Profile includes [links](http://stackexchange.com/users/94826/cboettig?tab=accounts) to other stackexchange platforms I use.
- __[<i class="ai ai-orcid"></i> ](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-628X)__ If anything should be the canonical reference network, it would be ORCID. My publication list, current position, and funding should be relatively up-to-date there. 

## (Somewhat) maintained profiles 

There are far too many academic profiles that want to portray a researcher's publications etc. Many have an automated or semi-automated discovery algorithm to add new works, with interesting results.  My website [vita](/vita.html) is probably the best reference.


* __[<i class = "ai ai-figshare"></i> ](http://figshare.com/authors/Carl%20Boettiger/96387)__ -- Figshare is a convenient archive of other scholarly outputs, including grant applications, theses, etc; though I use Dryad (data associated with pubs in Dryad-integrated journals), KNB (richer metadata) and Zenodo (mostly for Github-integration with software) as well. Note that the latter don't have the same concept of user profiles and network and thus aren't listed separately here. 
* __[<i class="ai ai-impactstory"></i> ](https://impactstory.org/CarlBoettiger)__ Does a nice job drawing in data from other sites such as ORCID, rather than implementing yet another web crawler that needs babysitting. It also provides relatively transparent metrics such as Scopus citations, instead of whatever Google's bot thinks is a citation. Unlike almost all other profiles, it does nice job providing and distinguishing between categories such as data, software, and publications, and allows a user to directly connect open access preprints to subscription journal articles. 
* __[<i class = "ai ai-google-scholar"></i>](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zj2rRtEAAAAJ)__ -- See what Google thinks are my publications, along with it's take on my citation data. Sign up for alerts.
* __[<i class = "ai ai-mendeley"></i> ](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carl-boettiger/)__ -- I maintain several public groups reflecting my reading in various projects, but not always up-to-date. My personal profile is rarely updated. 
* __[<i class = "fa fa-flickr"></i> ](http://www.flickr.com/people/cboettig/)__ -- For a few years my research scripts automatically post a copy of any figure they generate to Flickr.  This creates a deal of junk and a lot of duplication, but it also provides a timestamped, linkable record of just about everything I look at.  Images can be tagged by project, which is only semi-automated. Most images should at least automatically include the code hashes for creating them, which at least theoretically would allow me to identify the project and commit during which the image was generated. More recently I have relied on svg-based images hosted from Github).
* __[<i class="fa fa-slideshare"></i> ](http://www.slideshare.net/cboettig)__ -- I have tried and keep most of my presentations archived on Slideshare, which provides convenient statistics and embedded viewing tools. Previously I archived slides and posters on Nature's Preceedings preprint server, and may shift to Figshare for this purpose. I don't keep up on this as well recently (various reasons: time overhead, having to be careful about image reuse rights, increasing use of HTML5 slides).
* <a href="https://plus.google.com/112929796403983408632?rel=author"><strong><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i> Google Plus</strong></a> -- Still find this difficult to use. I'll stick with twitter.
* __[<i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> ](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cboettig/)__ -- I don't use the platform much, but I suppose it can make a handy address book?
* __[<i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i> ](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carl_Boettiger)__ -- I don't use the platform much but at the time of writing it seems to include a cross-section of the research community who are not so represented across some of the other networks.
