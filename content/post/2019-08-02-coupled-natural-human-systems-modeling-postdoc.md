We're looking to hire a coupled natural-human systems post-doc to work on the theory and modeling components of an NSF Coupled Natural Human Systems [award] seeking to understand the the interplay between [diversified farming systems] and ecosystem services.  Our team consists of a diverse and tight-knit group of social science and natural science researchers combining field research, farmer surveys, and mathematical modeling, based in UC Berkeley and focusing on California Central Coast farmers.  We take a decision-theoretic approach to understand the role of shocks (both ecological and regulatory), environmental change, economics, land tenure, social dynamics and other forces in their adoption of ecosystem-based practices. The interface of agriculture and ecology offers questions of both pressing societal relevance and rich opportunities for theory development in socio-ecological systems.  

The theory post-doc would be based in the Boettiger lab, and work closely with project leads Timothy Bowles, Claire Kremen, Alastair Iles and the rest of the team.  We seek to provide a welcoming, supportive environment and prioritizes professional development of our post-doctoral colleagues.  Please get in touch with [Dr. Carl Boettiger] for any questions.
