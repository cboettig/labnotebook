I work on problems in ecological forecasting and decision making under uncertainty, with applications for global change, conservation and natural resource management. I am interested in how we can predict or manage systems that may experience regime shifts: sudden and dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available data. The rapid expansion in both computational power and the available ecological and environmental data enables and requires new mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to these questions. My approach blends ecological theory with the synthesis of heterogeneous data and the development of software -- a combination now recognized as data science.


Carl Boettiger grew up in Philadelphia suburbs while spending summers at Woods Hole, MA, where the Children's School of Science instilled an early love of marine biology that has never left him.  As an undergraduate at Princeton University, the  problem-solving, team-oriented nature of his Physics classes led him to major in Physics while pursuing independent research in complex systems with faculty in ecology and evolution.  Drawn into ecological research, he completed his PhD with Alan Hastings at UC Davis and an NSF post-doctoral position at UC Santa Cruz and the Southwest Fisheries Science Center with Marc Mangel and Steve Munch. Carl is now an assistant professor of ecoinformatics in UC Berkeley's department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. Carl is an active supporter and practitioner of Open Science, and a co-founder of the scientific open source software collaborative, rOpenSci, as well as the Rocker Project.
