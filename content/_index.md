Welcome to the research group of Carl Boettiger, Associate Professor in the Department of
[Environmental Science, Policy and Management](http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu)
at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu).

We work on problems in ecological forecasting and decision making under
uncertainty, with applications for global change, conservation and
natural resource management. I am particularly interested in how we can
predict or manage ecological systems that may experience regime shifts:
sudden and dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available
data.  The rapid expansion in both computational power and the available
ecological and environmental data enables and requires new mathematical,
statistical and computational approaches to these questions. Ecology
has much to learn about what are and are not useful from advances in
informatics & computer science, just as it has from statistics and
mathematics. Traditional approaches to ecological modeling and resource
management such as stochastic dynamic systems, Bayesian inference, and
optimal control theory must be adapted both to take advantage of all
available data while also dealing with its imperfections. My approach
blends ecological theory with the synthesis of heterogeneous data and
the development of software -- a combination now recognized as data
science.


I am a co-founder and faculty adviser to the Schmidt Center for Data Science
& Environment at UC Berkeley ([DSE](https://dse.berkeley.edu)),
an advisory board member for the NSF Environmental Data Science Innovation
and Inclusion Lab ([ESIIL](https://esiil.org)) at Colorado, Boulder,
and a co-founder of the open source community projects [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org)
and [Rocker](https://rocker-project.org).
