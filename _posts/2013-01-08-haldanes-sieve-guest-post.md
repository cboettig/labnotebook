# Consider public archiving for your dissertation

As researchers we spend an immense amount of time generating products other
than papers. While we go through great lengths to see that our papers are
published in just the right place to be seen by our colleagues (fretting about
the different impact factors, percieved audience, editorial boards, open access
policies, and many other factors that determine just how a paper will see the
light of day), other products of our labors largely languish on forgotten
hard-drives from long ago.

Among the items that recieve considerable investiment of blood, sweat and tears
in not only producing but formating just right, etc, is the PhD dissertation.
As much of this work will no doubt eventually make its way into various
formal publications, if it hasn't already, it easy to view the process more as
ritual than practical, whose only outcome will be another dusty black cover
to grace the darkest shelves of the University library and the office of any
adviser over fifty.  Yet dissertations have more practical uses than bookends
as well.

A dissertation is frequently the first time certain results will see the
light of day, and may offer a more accessible introduction with more
complete review of background material than a published paper, thanks
to the long-hand monograph style that seems to be out of vogue in the
peer reviewed literature.  Dissertation acknowledgements often provide
wonderful snapshot into the toils of a PhD in recognizing contributions
and support. And while the published results may appear only in journals
requiring subscriptions, the author can almost always still release the
original thesis as open access to gain the potential benefits of larger
readership.[^1]

While some dissertations have been important references to me during my
own PhD and beyond, they aren't always easy to find -- for me, author's
webpages have been a more common source than University or publisher
catalogs. Meanwhile, many other researchers do not even mention their
dissertations on their own websites. Today, there are better and easier
alternatives for sharing your dissertation.

An increasing recognition of other products of research has led to a
proliferation of possible outlets to share research materials. Repositories
such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) and [Figshare](http://figshare.com) are
indexed by Google Scholar, provide reliable persistent storage, and
permanent identifiers or DOIs that can make it easy to cite or link.
