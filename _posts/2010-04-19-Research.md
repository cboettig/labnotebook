-   Sent Peter updated draft of Labrids manuscript
-   Writing up logarithms manuscript finally...
-   Contacting Helen re. primates data
-   Created Labrid Functional Morphology literature collection:

* * * * *

[Research](http://www.mendeley.com) collected using Mendeley

-   Started stochastic methods and model inference collection:

* * * * *

[Research](http://www.mendeley.com) collected using Mendeley

Various To Do
-------------

-   Add Peter's bootstrap references and books to stochastic methods and
    model inference library.
-   Add Science of Science papers to Future of Science collection.
-   Adding tags, abstracts, etc to Mendeley public Library
-   Personal/extended task view (and opinion?) on R comparative methods?
-   Summarize existing methods on notebook coverpage.

Notes
-----

-   Reviewing ways to collaborate on LaTeX -- hmm, converting into open
    office format may make the most sense for manuscripts, as layout
    isn't important anyway. Mendeley plugin for references in openoffice
    is quite nice.
-   Converting my LaTeX files to document format:

1.  latex2rtf simple, reliable for text, ok for figures, seems to fail
    on equations/symbols and formating.
2.  [tex4ht](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/ "http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/")
    seems the best way if the tex document is configured to produce dvi.
    Still need a pdflatex solution. i.e.

~~~~ {.de1}
htlatex filename "xhtml,ooffice" "ooffice/! -cmozhtf" "-coo -cvalidate"
~~~~

-   An [excellent
    guide](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Collaborative_Writing_of_LaTeX_Documents "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Collaborative_Writing_of_LaTeX_Documents")
    here on collaborating on latex, basically through version management
    methods though.
-   [Scribtex](http://www.scribtex.com/ "http://www.scribtex.com/"), an
    online tex editor looks particularly promising.
-   The openwetware page on LaTeX is also quite useful, and the OWW
    LaTeX extension makes OWW another LaTeX collaborative solution.
