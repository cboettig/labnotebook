Fig 2

-   Decided that bootstrapping against fixed model parameters would be
    more difficult to interpret, Fig 1.
-   Simulated data results with refitting seem strange (Fig. 2), perhaps
    related to fitting of the tree. Observed LR for data should at least
    remain symmetric, so something has gone wrong.
-   Expected pattern should be deducible simply by upper left triangle
    of graphs, should accept the first model where the data becomes
    typical.
