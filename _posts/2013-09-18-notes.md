- nonparametric-bayes writing writing. see commits.
- Started slides for Mangel group retreat. (in progress).
- Working on requested review... background reading too.
- reml read methods for `data.set` class, extending `attributeList` metadata tools.  


### Scribble notes for interivew

- we are where math was 400 years ago - present theorem without proof.  
- code plays an ever-increasing role in our research, and hence in describing what we have done
- potentially the most precise and consise way to describe a method.  Also potentially the most obuscated or incoherent 
- we value writing. we value clean and documented wet lab technique.  

- inline code vs software papers.  Mozilla will focus on the former. the latter is more difficult. 
- practices external to the code itself matter -- maintenance, test suites, version control
