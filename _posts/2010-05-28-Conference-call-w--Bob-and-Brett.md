-   So far no large noise in larval class alone, several potential
    mechanisms we may have missed so far:

### Getting large noise in larva

-   Noise from egg class (due to nonlinear dynamics)
-   Nonlinearity in larval class due to large larva eating smaller ones
-   Unknown effect of more realistic aging/stage transitions.
-   Long transients? -- Experiments start with larva, pupa, adults to
    speed up transient period.
