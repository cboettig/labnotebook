**editorial note**: These notes pre-date the formal start of my online
laboratory notebook, [Feb 2 2010: The Lab Notebook Goes Open](http://carlboettiger.info/2010/02/02/The-Lab-Notebook-Goes-Open-.html)
and were adapted from a LaTeX document in which I kept notes on this topic
during my summer at [IIASA](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/).  Lacking a proper notebook then, documents
like this one were updated periodically and occassionally branched into
new ones.  The post date represents the last time the 
LaTeX document was edited in the course of that research. 



Introduction
============

Our calculation of the time until branching occurs consists of the
following approach. The first requirement for branching to occur is the
existence of two mutually invasible populations separated by an adaptive
minimum, that is $s(y,x) >0$, $s(x,y)>0$ and $\partial^2_y s(y,x)>0$.
The minimum (curvature condition) is provided by a singular point of the
branching type, which also assures us that there will be some pairs
$(y,x)$ near each other $|y-x| \sim o(\sigma_{\mu})$. These points
define a coexistence region in the pairwise invasibility plot, which we
denote $P_2$. A mutant enters this region by “jumping the gap” from the
line $y=x$ into the coexistence region. This gap diminishes in width as
the resident trait $x$ nears the branching point, where the gap vanishes
all together. This criterion can be evaluated directly at regular
intervals throughout the simulation.

Most often this condition will arise only transiently – a single mutant
satisifying the conditions but soon lost to drift. Hence our second
requirement must be that the mutant successfully entering the
coexistence region then proceeds to survive drift. Defining this second
condition rigorously is less straight-forward. For large populations,
the probability of survival may be well approximated by the
Galton-Watson branching process. In theory, this probability can be
converted into an expected waiting time in a straight-forward manner. In
simulation, this is insufficent, as we want to identify the actual
waiting time we need more than a probability – we need to indentify
which populations actually survive. If selection is strong, we may hope
to identify which populations have effectively survived drift by
establishing some low-density threshold at which we declare the
population successful. Of course, this introduces a discrepancy in the
definition of waiting time, as the theory calculates the time until a
successful mutant occurs, while the simulation lags behind by the time
required to go from one individual to the threshold size.

If selection is strong, we can set this threshold quite low, and more
importantly, the time to reach the threshold will be quite small
compared to the time spent waiting for the mutation, and theory and
simulation should match reasonably well. This latter observation is
particularly convenient in that our calculation shouldn’t depend much on
the choice of threshold, as once the mutant establishes several clones
the probability of survival quickly asymptotes to unity. If selection is
weak, we are not so fortunate. Even relatively large mutant populations
may be at substantial risk to extinction by drift, and this extinction
probability will depend quite strongly on the particular choice of
threshold. As selection becomes nearly neutral, no threshold may exist
that can guarentee the persistence of the mutant.

In each case, the persistence of the resident must also be considered,
as it is also protected by a selection coefficient when rare which may
be weaker than that of the mutant (depending on whether the mutant has
occurred closer to or farther from the branching point). If only weakly
protected, it too can be lost to drift. For the moment, let us consider
only the case of strong selection, where a small, arbitrary threshold
can reasonably guarentee the success of branching. Later we will want to
quantify the meaning of strong, relative to the influence of drift. For
now, it suffices that such a notion exists, and we need only focus on
the first two steps – a mutant occurs and survives drift with
probability given by its selective coefficent, to have a reasonable
approximation of the waiting time between simulation and experiment.

The loss of a mutant in the coexistence region even after invading a
significant fraction of the population does not preclude branching. The
population may continue to approach the branching point where such
mutations are more common (do they have stronger selection too?) Even in
the purely neutral case, the dimorphism may persist long enough for a
new mutant to arise. This allows the populations to take another
mutational steps apart, where selection may be strong enough to protect
the dimorphism. The ability for larger populations to be able to survive
drift long enough for this to occur may allow them to branch in face of
weak selection where a smaller population would fail.

(A resource kernel that is similar in width to the competition kernel
but very wide compared to the mutational step size may approach the
branching region only by drift – fixing weakly deleterious mutations. )

Calculation
===========

The probability of such a mutant occurring in our monomorphic population
of trait $x$ is given by the probability that any mutant occurs (given
by the population size, approximately $K(x)$ at equilibrium, times the
birth rate $b(x)$ times the mutation rate $\mu$) times the probability
that the mutation lies on the opposite side of the coexistence boundary,
which we denote as $\phi(x)$ and $\psi(x)$, which is $\phi(x)$ reflected
across the line $y=x$. This depends on the mutational kernel, $M(y,x)$
which gives the probability that a mutant arising from a resident
population of trait $x$ bears trait $y$ that falls withing the
coexistance region as follows:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\phi(x)} M(y,x) \mathrm{d}y + \int_{\psi(x)}^{\infty} M(y,x) \mathrm{d}y$$

Without loss of generality let us assume that the singular strategy
$x^* = 0$ and that we start from some trait value $x_0 > x^*$.
Additionally, let us we assume $M(y,x)$ is Gaussian in $y-x$ with mean 0
and variance $\sigma_{\mu}^2$. However, we do not wish to consider all
such mutants $y$, but only those that survive. We multiply the
probability of a mutant having trait $y$, $M(y,x)$, times the
probability that is survives drift. This probability we quote from the
Galton-Watson branching process, $1-\tfrac{d(y,x)}{b(y,x)}$. Taking as
our model the individual birth $b$ and death $d$ rates to be:

$$\begin{aligned}
b(y,x) &= r\\
d(y,x) &= r\frac{C(y,x)K(x)}{K(y)}\end{aligned}$$

where $K$ is a Gaussian kernel with mean $x^*$, $K(x^*) = K_0$ and
variance $\sigma^2_k$ and $C(y,x)$ a Gaussian kernel in $y-x$ with mean
$0$, $C(0) =1$ and variance $\sigma^2_c$. Using this choice of model,
the probability of surviving branching is

$$1-\frac{C(y,x)K(x)}{K(y)} := S(y,x)
\label{S}$$

which we denote as $S(y,x)$ as indicated. Hence we modify our integral
to consider all mutants $y < x^*$ which occur with probability $M(y,x)$
and then survive with probability $S(y,x)$, and write down the rate
$P(x)$ at which a mutant which leads to branching occurs from our
monomorphic population with trait $x$:

$$P(x) := r \mu K(x)\left( \int_{-\infty}^{\phi(x)} M(y,x) S(y,x) \mathrm{d}y + \int_{\psi(x)}^{\infty} M(y,x) S(y,x) \mathrm{d}y  \right)
\label{MSerf}$$

Though a little cumbersome, this can be written in nearly closed form
(using the error function). For our particular model $s(y,x)$, we can
write the boundaries $\phi(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ as

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi(x) = x\frac{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}+1}{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}-1} \nonumber \\
\psi(x) = x\frac{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}-1}{\frac{\sigma_k^2}{\sigma_c^2}+1}
\label{phipsi}\end{aligned}$$

Then, given a starting condition $x_0$, we can determine the expected
trait $x$ at time $t$ of a monomorphic resident population by
integrating the canonical equation,

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{2} \mu \sigma_{mu}^2 N^*(x) \partial_y s(y,x)$$

which for our model is

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{-x}{2\sigma_k^2} r \mu \sigma_{\mu}^2 K(x)$$

While no closed form solution exists for $x(t)$ in this case, if we
assume $x_0 \ll \sigma_k$ then to good approximation we can view $K(x)$
to be constant over the interval and take our path to be:

$$x(t) = x_0 \exp\left( -r \mu \sigma_{\mu}^2 K_0 t/\sigma_k^2\right)$$

Using this mean path, we can write down an approximation for the rate of
a branching mutant occurring as a function of time, $P(x(t))$. Using
this time dependent rate, the probability of not branching after time
$T$ is simply $\exp\left( - \int_0^T P(t)\mathrm{d}t \right)$. One minus
this is the probability branching by time $T$; i.e. the cumulative
density function, hence the probability density function for the waiting
time is:

$$\Pi(T) = P(x(T)) \exp\left( -\int_0^T P(x(t)) \right)
\label{pdf}$$

and the expected time until branching is
$\int_0^{\infty} T \Pi(T) \mathrm{d}T$. This is our first analytic
approximation.
