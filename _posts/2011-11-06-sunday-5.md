## Computing notes


A few configuration related things from migrating to the [new laptop](http://zareason.com/shop/Strata-Pro-13.html).


#### Clipboard and Vim


vim clipboard - install vim-gnome
"+y and "+p interact between vim and global clipboard, and y, shift+insert work within terminal.

make a repository bare so it can be pushed to (as opposed to moving to it's working directory and running a pull). From [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199897/git-convert-normal-to-bare-repository):


```bash

mv repo/.git repo.git; rm -rf repo
cd repo.git
git config --bool core.bare true

```



#### Lab Notebook


It would be nice to be able to browse my flickr research images and see which ones have been embedded in what lab notebook pages automatically.

Unfortunately,[ it seems ](webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/11279/cboettig)there is no way to track ping backs on flickr images?  Meanwhile did configure flickr's stats utility, which seems to give only detailed stats (including inbound links) over the past 28 days.  The Flickr API app [statr](http://statsr.net/user/) claims to log the rest, though won't resolve full referring urls without pro account, and neither of these are proper pingbacks of linked photos.

### Phylogenetics


* Prepare notes on QuaSSE for seminar.  See Mendeley copy.
* Updated MCMCtools, for some basic QuaSSE exploration.  Roxygenize documentation and add some convenient priors.
