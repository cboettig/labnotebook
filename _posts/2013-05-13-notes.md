### Prosecutor's Fallacy comment

* Fallacy comment revisions
* Comment reply letter (draft)
* ROC curves instead?  ([examples](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/blob/abcc1cd727f2a45ee7cbb2220135a6ebfc3e4277/inst/doc/roc_curves.md))
* Add example of system with an alternative stable state?

### Policy costs (pdg-control)

* touched up [tex document](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/master/inst/doc/policycosts/policycosts_PRA.tex) following Paul's edits (mostly reflects comments and decisions from Meeting 3).  Reminder of why collaborating on TeX documents can be annoying even when co-authors are tex-literate.  Attempted quick conversion to markdown but mapping is troublesome.  

## Misc

* Some [software](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX) providing rather impressive/high fidelity pdf to html conversion...  Not just rendering as images -- the text is searchable, though in the html source it just looks like a bunch of binary data URIs.  
* Scathingly honest review of the classical ecological statistics text by Sokal and Rohlf ([pdf](http://t.co/5IioNf1p1y)) 
* [PNAS hates mathematics](http://www.steinsaltz.me.uk/pnas.html) Not really, but a depressing example of poor reviewing.
