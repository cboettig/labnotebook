Discussing elements of likelihood ratio manuscript and review results
from release of constraint data. Figure out what to include in one
manuscript, what order to present elements in, and what examples are
necessary.

-   Phylogenetic Signal introduction. Need for examples? A good example
    where phylogenetically independent contrasts is misleading, but
    lambda/K definition of phylogenetic signal is also misleading.
-   Power in phylogenetic tree:

-   Likelihood ratio and model choice: Monte Carlo LR approach, support
    in the literature

    -   Release of Constraint. [Cetartiodactyle body
        size](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Carl_Boettiger/Notebook/Comparative_Phylogenetics/2010/07/28),
        [Parrotfish](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Carl_Boettiger/Notebook/Comparative_Phylogenetics/2010/07/26),
