Mostly getting Prosecutor's Fallacy example to run with large enough sample sizes.  Finer sampling or more replicates than current settings seems to crash MPI connections over farm cluster, probably a memory issue.  Oh well, looks like I've got a good enough sample size here.

Citations on Jekyll
-------------------

No ideal solution here at the moment, a couple options:

- Pandoc: My intended solution,  Disadvantages: converts everything to it's own markdown format, which messes up my PHP Markdown tables and YAML frontmatter. Also chokes on large bibtex files, so I need to run bibtool / my bibgen script to generate the bib file first. Perhaps a scripted solution can get around this.   
- Use knit+R to generate citations with my [knitcitations](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations) package.  Advantages: customizable, can run on DOIs without needing to bother with bibtex. Easiest to extend with metadata in citations, such as CiTO.  Disadvantages: not very polished, citation formating needs help.  
- [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar): Perhaps the most promising of the citation plugins.
