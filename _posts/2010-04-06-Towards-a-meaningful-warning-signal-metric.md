-   Most papers do not give a statistical approach, but merely argue for
    the existence of a trend.
-   Kendall's tau approach proved very unreliable. While the preliminary
    de-trending approach is unjustified in that the simulated data is
    known to be absent from trends, as a kind of windowed averaging it
    may sense as a way to detect changes.
-   Should distinguish between the gradual slow changes and change-point
    estimation. Perhaps change-point provides a more rigorous starting
    point.
-   need to predict the expected variance in the various warning
    signals, this entry
