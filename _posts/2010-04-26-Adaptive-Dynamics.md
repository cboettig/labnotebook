Matching theoretical approximations to simulation:

-   Implemented the first analytic approximation, calculating the
    waiting time to complete phase 1.
-   Established dimophisms are often still lost, hence the first
    successful completion of phase 1 (dimorphic population in
    coexistence region with each above threshold size) doesn't match the
    time of the last completion of phase 1. Phase 2, an established
    third population seems to happen soon after the last successful
    phase 1, giving the illusion this step is easy rather than the
    reality that this process requires fast traversal to persist past
    the coexistence time.

### Computing notes

-   Making sure to export the library using useDynLib(file) in the
    NAMESPACE and using sfLibrary eliminates the need to load the
    dynamic library onto each node using the method from earlier .
