- added generation of observational data under varying harvest conditions (issue [#19](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/issues/19))

- added MLE fit based on the data-generating model (issue [#20](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/issues/20))

- GP plot with and without nugget variance (issue [#17](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/issues/17))

- Run longer simulations under policy such that sustainable profits clearly beat out collapsing the fishery (part of issue [#22](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/issues/22))
