## Better tagging practices

* Standardize use of tags: Match tags in notebook to project repository name.  Tag papers in Mendeley by these tags as well. 

I have also started tracking the medium of discovery for each paper I add to my Mendeley collection through a little set of Mendeley tags.  I am curious to see through which mediums I obtain the most content, and what content.  As with any ontology, I will struggle to select a vocabulary that is precise enought to be useful without being too verbose (b) to bother to continue to use this. We'll see how I do.
