-   Weekly check-in, following up on last week's meeting.

### Goals for meeting

-   Discuss goals for regime shifts seminar tomorrow
-   Discuss my manuscript outline on detection limits for early warning
    signals
-   Discuss energy model formulation for analytic approximations to
    *Tribolium* model.

### Meeting Notes

-   **Early warning signals** - starting in simple models, proof of
    principle. Discuss three challenges to detection:

1.  ergodicity
2.  sensitivity
3.  complexity

-   Eventually develop robust tools to give confidence estimates
    (parametric bootstrap) on potential early warning signals. Tool
    could be implemented as an R package.
    -   Follow up with Darren
    -   General model testing principles: see Noel Cressie (spatial
        statistics). Durrett.

-   **Structured Populations**
    -   I'm now using energy tracking to make the system Markov.
    -   Implemented in the analytics, need to add to energy accounting
        to simulation.
    -   Suggested further background reading, including some of the work
        of S.A.S. Kooijman, and

### Conferences

-   Also touched on possible conferences to attend this summer.
    Discussed
    **[Conference](http://www.sm.u-bordeaux2.fr/CMPD3/index.html "http://www.sm.u-bordeaux2.fr/CMPD3/index.html")**
    on Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics. Should I go?
    Probably.

### Targets for Next Week

1.  Early warning signals examples of three challenges
2.  Add the various warning signal metrics to the regime shifts
    simulation
3.  Add energy accounting to the beetles.
