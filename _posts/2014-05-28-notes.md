I'm pretty happy with the way `rmarkdown` looks like it can pretty much replace my [Makefile approach]() with a simple R command to `rmarkdown::render()`.  Notably, a lot of the pandoc configuration can already go into the document's `yaml` header (bibliography, csl, template, documentclass, etc), avoiding any messing around with the Makefile, etc.

Even more exciting is the pending RStudio integration with pandoc.  This exposes the features of the `rmarkdown` package to the RStudio IDE buttons, but more importantly, seems like it will simplify the pandoc/latex dependency issues cross-platform.

In light of these developments, I wonder if I should separate my manuscripts from their corresponding R packages entirely (and/or treat them as vignettes?)  I think it would be ideal to point people to a single `.Rmd` file and say "load this in RStudio" rather than passing along a whole working directory.

The `rmarkdown::render` workflow doesn't cover installing the dependencies, or downloading the a pre-built cache. I've been relying on the R package mechanism itself to handle dependencies, though I list all packages loaded by the manuscript but not needed by the package functions themselves as `SUGGESTS`, as one would do with a vignette. Consequently, I've had to add an [install.R]() script to my template, to make sure these packages are installed before a user attempts to run the document.  The install script feels like a bit of a hack, and makes me think that RStudio's packrat may be what I actually want for this.  So I finally got around to playing with [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).


## packrat

Packrat isn't yet on CRAN, and for an RStudio package I admit that it feels a bit clunky still. Having a single `packrat.lock` file (think `Gemfile.lock` I suppose) seems like a great idea.  Carting around the hidden files `.Rprofile`, `.Renviron`, and the `tar.gz` sources for all the dependences (in `packrat.sources`) seems heavy and clunky, and logging in and out all the time feels like a hack.

- Am I really supposed to commit the `.tar.gz` files? [packrat/issues/59](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat/issues/59) (Summary: option coming)

- Do I really need to restart R [packrat/issues/60](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat/issues/60) (Summary: yes).


The first discussion led to an interesting question about just how big are CRAN packages these days anyhow?  Thanks to this clever `rsync` trick from Duncan, I could quickly explore this:

```r
txt = system("rsync --list-only cran.r-project.org::CRAN/src/contrib/ | grep .tar.gz", intern = TRUE)
setAs("character", "num.with.commas", function(from) as.numeric(gsub(",", "", from) ) )
ans = read.table(textConnection(txt), colClasses=c("character", "num.with.commas", "Date", "character"))
ggplot(ans, aes(V3, V2)) + geom_point()
sum(ans$V2>1e6)
sum(ans$V2/1e6)
```

Note that there are 711 packages over 1 MB, for a total weight of over 2.8 GB. Not huge but more than you might want in a Git repo all the same.


Nevertheless, packrat works pretty well.  Using a bit of a hack [we can](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/packrat-discuss/sm46dsvLxSk) just version manage/ship the `packrat.lock` file and let packrat try and restore the rest.

```r
packrat::packify()
source(".Rprofile"); readRenviron(".Renviron")
packrat::restore()
source(".Rprofile"); readRenviron(".Renviron")
```

The `source`/`readRenviron` calls should really be restarts to R.  Tried replacing this with calls to `Rscript -e "packrat::packify()` etc. but that fails to find `packrat` on the second call.  (Attempting to reinstall it doesn't work either).

Provided the sources haven't disappeared from their locations on Github, CRAN, etc., I think this strategy should work just fine.  More long-term, we would want to archive a tarball with the `packrat.sources`, perhaps downloading it from a script as I currently do with the cache archive.







knitcitations
-------------


Debugging check reveals some pretty tricky behavior on R's part: it wants to check the R code in my vignette even though it's not building the vignette.  It does this by tangling out the code chunks, which ignores in-line code.  Not sure if this should be a bug in knitr or R, but it can't be my fault ;-). See [knitr/issues/784](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/784)

With checks passing, have sent v0.6 to CRAN.  Fingers crossed...

Milestones for [version 0.7](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/issues?milestone=4&state=open) should be able to address the print formatting issues, hopefully as a new `citation_format` option and without breaking backwards compatibility.
