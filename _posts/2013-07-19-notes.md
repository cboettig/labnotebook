- Keep metadata as part of the object
- Recursion problem coming up.  

## Validating: 

- https://github.com/ropensci/reml/issues/7
- Duncan has code using Matt's java API 
- If the EML isn't valid, so what?  Important for developers, users don't care.  


## API design

- what's with the `do.call`? This forces evaluation, can mess up lazyLoading, making for inefficient function handling.   
- Schema to create S4 objects
- Create R objects first, and then toXML  

## XMLSchema 

- will improve as we go 

## Paper outline

- EML exists -- metadata vs vertical
- metadata manual in, manual out 
- data synthesis?



### R object to XML   

- Accept / identify losely defined fields (lists)
- Manually create a coercision method between R's objects, e.g. "person" (attempt match of named elements to list slots automatically).  
- Separate coersion methods for read and write.  

### XML to R object

- ParseEML - because it saves us a lot to know this is EML.  
- Coerce into generic S4 R classes (class definitions from schema)
- Coerce automatically if element names are the same.  Otherwise, manually coerce.  



### Further possibilities

- Translations to other languages (e.g. python) can be automated.  
- Then add higher level mapping manually.
