-   Working on manuscript for this today, hope to have a draft soon.

-   Just added a basic example using a star-burst tree to illustrate the
    challenges associated with this kind of model choice inference.

-   Sent draft to Brian and Peter, and Wainwright lab.

-   Still needs a figure explaining the BM, OU(1) and OU(LP) models for
    those not familiar with Butler and King 2004 paper, general
    polishing.

### Further Revisions based on feedback

-   Need to explain the simulation approach much more clearly as a model
    testing alternative to AIC/SIC. Need to explain how this can be done
    independent of AIC/SIC. Need proper discussion section.
