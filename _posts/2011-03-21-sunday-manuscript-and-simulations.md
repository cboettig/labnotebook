Working on manuscript.  lot of writing / editing.

Edited package and example to include skew and kurtosis bootstrap estimates of tau.  Currently testing.



	
  * m = -0.04, N = 50, nboot = 160, (with all moments)

	
  * m = -0.04, N = 50, nboot = 800, (with all moments)

	
  * m = -0.05, N = 50, nboot = 800, (with all moments)

	
  * m = -0.02, N = 500, nboot = 800 (without skew/kurtosis yet)
