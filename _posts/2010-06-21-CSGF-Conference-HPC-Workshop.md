I found the breakout sessions in the afternoon particularly fascinating
for their paradigm-breaking look into the future of high performance
computing. While FLOPS become free, huge scale and ultra-low-power
devices (little voltage difference to identify bits) make error handling
a topic of major concern, and the idea of "wasting" processors to
perform redundant calculations to avoid errors becomes quite serious.
Other ideas, like moving computation around the memory instead of the
reverse, the rise of large data and questioning the role of GPU and
other novel architecture was also an important theme. Breaking out of
the cycle of simply scaling up the MPI paradigm will open new questions
but require new hardware, new algorithms, and new kinds of thinking.
