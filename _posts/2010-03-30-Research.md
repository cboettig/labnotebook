### Current Situation & Challenges

2000 bootstraps of models fitted to simulated ou2 data

-   A single data set is produced by simulation under a specified ou2
    model on the Labrid tree (actually one that was fitted to the
    original Labrid data).
-   Each model (Brownian motion and 1 to 5 separate OU peaks (assigned
    by my partition function) is fitted to this dataset.
-   Each fitted model is used to generate 2000 replicate datasets
-   For each replicate dataset, the model used to generate it is
    compared to each other model in likelihood ratio test 2(log(*L*~1~)
    âˆ’ log(*L*~2~)), where *L*~1~ is the likelihood of the model that
    generated the data. In this version, the model likelihood is simply
    evaluated with its original parameter assignments, not refit to the
    data first.
-   **The pattern** seems to be: each model fit the data it produced
    better than any other model, particularly for the more complicated
    models. Consequently, the bootstrap distributions are always
    positive.
-   The more complicated models have higher likelihood scores on the
    original data, making the location of the red line marking the
    original data always fall in the negative region for the upper
    triangle of the graph matrix, where simulations coming from simpler
    models are compared against the more complicated ones. This seems to
    consistently reject the simpler model in favor of the complicated
    one.
-   Meanwhile, the lower triangle compares data generated under the
    complicated against the simple. When the complex (ou2+) are compared
    against ou1 and bm in this way, the simple model does not reject the
    complex one -- that is, data produced by the complex model scores an
    expected amount better than the simple one; the red line falls near
    the center of the bootstrap distribution.
-   However, as the models get more complex, the data appears to fall at
    relatively unlikely small scores. (comparing ou2 vs ou3 for
    instance) This suggests while the more complex model is still
    performing better, one would actually suspect it to perform much
    better still than it actually is; and on the whole its performance
    is unexpectedly poor for it to be the correct model.
-   The balance of rejecting one but not both comparisons might make an
    argument for ou2 being correct, though the case is not as clear as
    might hope with simulated data. Of course the power to distinguish
    depends on the tree as well.

-   **[ievobio conference](http://ievobio.org/ "http://ievobio.org/")**
    Registration

-   Interesting seminar by [Ilias
    Tagkopoulos](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/tagkopoulos.html "http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/tagkopoulos.html")
    at CPB today. Good example of high performance computing for
    stochastic simulations. Latest versions are also explicitly spatial.
    Strange choice of birth death dynamics however -- fixed population
    size, and when birth occurs, a weaker individual is replaced, when
    death occurs, a random individual replaces it. Resembles the Moran
    model, though other work has shown order is important here.
