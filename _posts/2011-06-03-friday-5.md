## Reading:

Mostly education stuff: 


* Excellent [New Yorker piece](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/06/06/110606crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all) on the value of a college education.
* Kandace sent this wonderful piece in Science, in which 7 HHMI fellows outline 7 initiatives for changing the balance of research and teaching (Anderson _et. al._ 2011):
  1. Educate faculty about research on learning
  2. Create awards/named professorships supporting outstanding teachers
  3. Require excellence in teaching for promotion
  4. Create teaching discussion groups (of colleagues)
  5. Create cross-disciplinary programs at college-level learning
  6. Provide ongoingÂ  support for effective science teaching (i.e. NSF grants)
  7. Engage chairs, deans, presidents
	
* Better still is this nice lecture response to the paper, addressing (1).
* [Should the Culture of University Science Education Be Changed?](http://www.physics.indiana.edu/~hake)
