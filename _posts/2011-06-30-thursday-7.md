## Alan meeting

#### Figure 3: ROC curves corresponding to standard approach


Do we show the distributions? -- Create for each, but log in appendix

ROC curves corresponding to increased sampling -- our method, other stats? organize how?


## Computational Runs


Running at constant sample points rather than sample effort.

## Segue: Amazon cloud through a local R session


Rather computationally limited at the moment.  Tried [Segue](http://code.google.com/p/segue/) but don't seem to be able to run custom functions:

On to plan B: requesting time on the [caes cluster](http://cccc.caes.ucdavis.edu/)
