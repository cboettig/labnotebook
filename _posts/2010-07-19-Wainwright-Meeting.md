Discussed goals and appropriate approach. Settled on linear order rather
than trying to directly implement the full MCMC over paintings solution
directly. Breaks into four steps/manuscripts:

1.  Phylogenetic signal and model choice in Comparative Methods:
    Likelihood ratio approach
2.  Detecting changing constraints in evolution: varying alpha and sigma
    across the tree
3.  Bayesian approach for all existing continuous trait comparative
    methods
4.  MCMC over possible histories to infer number of niches
