Really excellent talk by Professor Michael Jordan from the Berkeley Statistics department visiting us at Davis yesterday. Haven't seen a talk cover technical content with remarkable clarity for the algorithms and insights involved, while also covering such a breadth of material. My notes didn't really keep up, but transcribing some of my scribbling into electronic form will have to wait until I have more time. (Their pubs are probably a better reference anyway.)

But to summarize,I enjoyed the bag of little bootstraps -- a very simple, elegant, and powerful idea. Divide-and-conquer meets Efron.<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5016" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Kleiner _et. al._ (2011)</a> 

I hadn't realized NetFlix prize could be thought of a matrix completion problem with justifiable assumption of low-rank, and was impressed both by how simple the best algorithm is and by the 10 fold speedup obtained by their approximate divide-and-conquer solution. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6002" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Mackey _et. al._ (2012)</a> 

Highlights the use of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs for giving you a differential-equation approach to proving things like central limit theorem, and a remarkably simple proof for a Bernstein-like large deviation result for matrices sounds pretty clever.
