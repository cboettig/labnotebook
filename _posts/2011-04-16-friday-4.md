## Reading





	
  * Arxiv has several articles on the [EM-algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm) from J. Statistical Science unknown, unknown.  What makes this distinct from applying any traditional optimization routine (Nelder-Mead, simulated annealing, etc) to the likelihood function?  Just in that it determines the probability distribution as well as maximum?

	
  * UPDATE ON EM: brief discussion with Graham, Peter, Yaniv on this, now my impression is: Not necessarily get the distribution, but doesn't just generically take a function and minimize it, but may not calculate the likelihood at each step.  Handles missing values, simulate the data.  We'll take a closer look at this in our Algorithms discussion group.

	
  * Also from the arxiv, nice [article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2854) by Nick Barton and colleagues on the role statistical mechanics has played in evolutionary biology.

	
  * [Interesting work](http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2908) on the arxiv on critical transitions from Christian, a post-doc in [Thilo Gross's group](http://www.biond.org/content/research) at Max Planck Complex Systems, Dresden.  Also meaning to look over there generalized models in food webs paper (Gross _et. al._ 2009).

	
  * Looks like a fantastic article on estimating diversification (speciation/extinction) rates in PNAS(Stadler, 2011), and an accompanying package, [TreePar](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreePar/index.html) (which actually looks like it's been on CRAN since last June).

	
  * Looking over this paper led me to a few others also by Tanja, discussing some of the challenges of simulating(Stadler, 2011) and sampling trees(Hartmann _et. al._ 2010).

	
  * See TreePar discussion [in later post.](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1423)
