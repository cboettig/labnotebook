Working on a couple new ideas:

-   Multiple partitions
-   Community phylogenetics nulls
-   Diversification rates w/ stationary distributions

Tools exploration
-----------------

-   Finding [my
    forum](http://phylogenetics.uservoice.com/forums/43843-general "http://phylogenetics.uservoice.com/forums/43843-general")
    a very useful tool for recording and organizing around idea. Nice
    complement to this notebook which helps me organize temporally
    instead.
-   Becoming convinced I should transition from svn to git. Created a
    [git-hub
    account](http://github.com/cboettig "http://github.com/cboettig")
    and have started learning the basic git commands. The [Git community
    book](http://book.git-scm.com/index.html "http://book.git-scm.com/index.html")
    and the [website video
    tutorials](http://learn.github.com/p/setup.html "http://learn.github.com/p/setup.html")
    have been very helpful.

-   Meanwhile,
    [RabbitVCS](http://rabbitvcs.org/ "http://rabbitvcs.org/") is a very
    slick SVN manager integrated directly into the Nautilus browser.
    I've also added the svn commands to hotkeys through my vimrc script.

-   listened to an interesting [talk by
    Willbanks](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2010/03/wilbanks "http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2010/03/wilbanks")
    on science commons and *Generative Science'.'*

Research
--------

Working on the multiple partitions question for discretization of
continuous data.

-   Maximum likelihood implementation in R for an arbitrary but fixed
    number of peaks.
-   Writing the MCMC approach now to allow Bayesian partitioning.
    -   Will be a good test case for the reversible jump process
    -   Potentially a good test case to explore Dirchlet Process Prior

### Project now has a [code repository](http://github.com/cboettig/Comparative-Phylogenetics "http://github.com/cboettig/Comparative-Phylogenetics")

-   Hosting through github.
-   Several advantages to the git system -- no central repository,
    easier branching / merging, faster.
-   github interface also seems to have several advantages relative to
    google code. In addition to supporting git, provides a more
    intuitive and visually appealing layout for the project.
