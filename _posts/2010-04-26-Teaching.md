 What better way to begin a discussion about assessment than with an
assessment? We began with a somewhat tongue-in-cheek quiz about the
"right" way to conduct an assessment, modelling some common faults in
poor assessments while also serving as a brainstorm to get some ideas
out there. We presented some background theory on assessment, drawing
from the excellent text: Handelsman, J., Miller, S., & Pfund, C.
[*Scientific
Teaching*](http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Teaching-Jo-Handelsman/dp/1429201886 "http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Teaching-Jo-Handelsman/dp/1429201886"),
highlighting three reasons for assessment:

1.  Quantifying student performance, measure students as learners
2.  Measuring our own effectiveness as instructors
3.  Motivate students

Handelsman offers a particular focus on the third with their concept
enGauge, tools that both measure performance and motivate engagement
with the material, often in real-time setting rather than waiting to the
final exam. From here we moved into general discussion that visited
various challenges in assessment, particularly in teaching and assessing
*process* rather than factual knowledge. [Moss

also has an excellent discussion of this challenge.
