Ah, back after being in bed almost a week with flu. Back to writing
manuscript, reworking the presentation of the actual method. Much of the
day caught up in Watson's practice orals (applying computational
mechanics to inhibitory neuron circuits), checking in with Yun on his
orals and then GTC. too many delays, hope I feel fully better soon.
