## Reading


Wait, the storage effect is often evolutionarily unstable? Yikes. (Snyder & Adler, 2011). Will have to read this more closely.



	
  * Vasseur & Fox nice AD paper in <del>PNAS</del> Am Nat (Vasseur & Fox, 2011), ((One day Am Nat will finish registering the doi for these papers?))




> Contrary to previous verbal arguments that suggest that character convergence leads to neutral stability, coadaptation of competing consumers always leads to stable coexistence. Furthermore, we show that incorporating costs of consuming or excreting excess nonlimiting nutrients selects for nutritionally balanced diets and so promotes character convergence.





	
  * Curious: phlyogenetic rate shifts in feeding _in Homo_ genus: (Organ _et. al._ 2011). An unfamiliar approach to me. Nice time-calibrated mophological-character tree of humans though. Now if only PNAS would consider requiring treebase archiving...



	
  * Best meta-population dataset ever (Hanski, 2011)? Looks like a nice paper, can't help feeling it would have huge impact if the data were made available. Without that, it's a bit hard to judge.



	
  * Great arxiv [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1595) on parallel computation to improve MCMC. Not the way I thought -- independent samples rather than independent chains. Which I had a better grasp or more time to go through this. Also, Robert's ABC critique paper is out (Robert _et. al._ 2011).



	
  * Also need to read (Liebhold & Bascompte, 2003)




## Writing


Working on Evolution revisions...


## Arithmetic


Bill got me started on automatic reporting from the clusters using some bash scripting. Still tweaking.
