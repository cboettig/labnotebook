## Reading


Some nice theoretical ecology papers out from our group recently, looking over today:



	
  * Paul's paper (Williams & Hastings, 2011) deals with some interesting work on persistence in complex models, (stochastic systems of mixture models), curious how it compares to the conclusions of (Schreiber, 2010).

	
  * Sebastian's paper (Schreiber _et. al._ 2011) with Dan Bolnick and Burger, another example of the importance of individual heterogeneity, this time in a nice phenotype/genotype specific way by combining quantitative genetics approaches with predator dynamics.

	
  * Jamie's paper: (Ashander _et. al._ 2011) on sea-lice with Mark Lewis.

	
  * Also my entry on [ABC](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1221) a few days ago suddenly gathered a bunch of traffic and suggested some more reading to me, Didelot _et. al._ 2011, thanks to [Dan Lawson](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/) at Bristol for pointing this out.  Sounds like there may be a straight-forward way to derive sufficient statistics for both models to allow comparisons, though not sure whether or not we are using even model-wise sufficient statistics in the new comparative phylogenetics applications.  Perhaps worth a bit more attention, but Didelot _et. al._ 2011 is certainly worth a read.




## Writing


Figures. Yesterday's to-do list. References. Wishing I could use tex instead of Word (okay, oowriter).  ﻿Methods summary: bootstrap, likelihood approach.  -- DONE


## Arithmetic





	
  * Run more empirical datasets through machinery for Figures 1-3, (probably for appendix).

	
  * Working out the math for the case of replicates.
