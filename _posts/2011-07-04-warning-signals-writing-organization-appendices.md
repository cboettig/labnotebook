## main text


Summary Sentence.Â Abstract


#### Paragraphs

1. Early Warning matter, no-one does statistics
2. We need quantify uncertainty stats
3. ROC curve shows this trade-off
4. ROC also compares different methods & data sizes (i.e. Fig 4)
5. Quantifying "increasing variance" etc -- we'll use tau
6. We'll also do a likelihood-based method
7. Introduce the datasets
8. ROC curves on the data, Fig 3
9. Quantifying data necessary, Fig 4
10. Disclaimers: Not completely general
11. Conclusion
