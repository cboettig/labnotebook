## CRAN trivia

### When should you bump version for a (rejected) resubmission?

> Once accepted, any change other than to the metadata (essentially the DESCRIPTION file) needs an increased version.  For submissions, we prefer (but do not insist on) a new number of each attempt.

  --Prof Brian Ripley

### Using non-CRAN repositories in SUGGESTS or ENAHANCES

More dubious tricks, from Yihui:

> FYI, here is how R core checks dependencies:
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L5195

> Because I know this, sometimes I intentionally use something like
(function(pkg) library(pkg, character.only = TRUE))("foo") to silence
R CMD check and cheat when I (optionally) need a package but do not
want CRAN maintainers to know it


## Package maintainence

- knitcitations 0.1.1 on CRAN now.

- See RNeXML check results: http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_RNeXML.html

- RNeXML Submitted a series of patches that allow tests not to fail when external resources (packages, web APIs) that are not available.

- rfigshare updated [#84](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/84). Triggered occassional errors from API failing, so most tests now skipped if authentication call fails. (Reworked authentication a bit)

- bugfix: [knitcitations/#63](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/issues/63#issuecomment-49459723)

## Misc

Taking a look at [auto]() for bifurcation diagrams (ht Noam, who is using the XPP wrapper).
