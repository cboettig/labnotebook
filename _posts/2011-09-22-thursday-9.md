Sent off review. finally.


## Sanchirico seminar

with [Tim Essington](http://fish.washington.edu/people/essington/) (U Washington). Goal: Prepare for a review on forage fisheries.


#### Outline


1. background
2. background
3. Fishery interactions
4. marine mammal/seabird interactions
5. Climate & forage fish
6. Fishmeal (Demand side)
7. direct consumption (Demand side)
8. Vitamin supp / health benefits (Demand side)
9. Non-market value marine mammals
10. Synthesis

Forage-fish: "foundation species" in marine ecosystems, get energy from zooplankton/upwelling to high-level predators (high-market target fisheries). Sardines/pilchards, anchovies, sandeels, krill, herrings, capelin, menhaden.


* Why this topic? Much interest, (e.g. (Smith _et. al._ 2011)) but little is known (either on economics, mostly primitive MSY based, or population dynamics, mostly ecopath based).
* variability -- large oscillations, e.g. [Baumgartner et al. 1992](http://ca-seafood.ucdavis.edu/news/wetfish/wf_reading/baumgart.pdf).
* catchability -- schooling, etcm so almost indepent of density.
* Many relevant spatial dynamics challenges.
