I've created the more extend-able [earlywarning](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/) package out of my [warningsignals](https://github.com/cboettig/warningsignals/) package.  The individual-based simulations are carried out separately via my new [populationdynamics](https://github.com/cboettig/populationdynamics) package.

Trying a knitr-based platform for tighter integration of code, figures, and text. See [today's analysis](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/wiki/appendices) in markdown generated by knitr, posted as a github wiki page.
