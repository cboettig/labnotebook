### Public code hosting

-   Project code now [available through
    Github](http://github.com/cboettig/AdaptiveDynamics "http://github.com/cboettig/AdaptiveDynamics").
-   **Advantages to public hosting:** Replication of adaptive dynamics
    simulations can be difficult, particularly in matching various
    nuisance parameters. While there is certainly much pedagogical value
    in individual researchers implementing their own simulations,
    verification and reproducibility of scientific results would be
    greatly facilitated by adapting an accepted open source code base
    and adding branches, etc. Researchers could much more immediately
    benefit from the work of their colleagues and spend more time
    implementing novel research and less reproducing it. Many eyes would
    ensure more robust, efficient and bug-free code.
-   Current code has a long way to come, particularly in terms of
    documentation.
-   The C-Matrix approach lacks the desired level of generality, though
    it does accelerate the calculations significantly compared to the
    straight forward implementation that would recalculate competition
    coefficients after each birth or death event instead of only after
    each mutation.
-   Motivation for public hosting partly comes partly from email request
    for the code from my fluctuation domains paper, in which a
    researcher pointed out the difficulty in replicating certain
    branching results.

Misc
----

-   Most work today in Stochastic Population Dynamics (second day of
    beetle workshop).
-   Migrated Firefox bookmarks to
    [delicious](http://delicious.com/cboettig "http://delicious.com/cboettig").
    Should encourage me to bookmark more frequently, slowly entering the
    modern world here.
-   [Enterprise
    2.0](http://launchpad.e2conf.com/vote-now/ "http://launchpad.e2conf.com/vote-now/")
    competition for enterprise solutions, have much in common with
    challenges in science. Wonder what we're already doing well vs what
    could be transfered from here.
-   Search history is an interesting source of statistics -- apparently
    I view 100-300 pages a day? Many are gmail/wiki/notebook pages,
    still.
-   Looked into website polling / voting schemes that can be added to
    websites, i.e. Facebook's
    [like](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like "http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like")
    button and the [digg
    button](http://about.digg.com/button "http://about.digg.com/button").
    A colleague was looking into ways to get students to rank the
    usefulness of various course content. Probably many other, possibly
    better solutions but an intriguing idea.
