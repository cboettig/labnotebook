  * Organizing for [Future of Data workshop](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/905).  Confirming time/room booking, etc.  Science makes open access a special issue on [Dealing with Data](http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/data/)
  * Hosting visiting prospective CPB student, scheduling events.
  * Going over edits questions with Peter R. on phylogenetics manuscript.
  * Editing/pruning plugins -- starting to choke my Wordpress hosting.  Folks at DreamHost have been very helpful, hopefully no key plugins are off. Apparently deactivating doesn't necessarily prevent plugin from contributing to the memory load. papercite is now off, ok since migrating to M. Fenner's system anyway.


**Still To Do**

  * Revisions on lambda section significance, send manuscript to Brian
  * PMC for Laser simulations -- what's going on with "a" estimate and wide uncertainty
  * Peter's question applied to bootstraps over trees (say, dist generated from bd simulation) vs parameter bootstraps of sigma vs stochastic mapping.  (email Peter back too about parameter bootstraps)
  * Alan manuscript: both conceptual figures, methods section
