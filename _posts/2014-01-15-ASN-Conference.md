**Note:** posting this considerably after the fact as I did not have a chance to make a proper entry during the conference.

Some highlights (such as on the top of my head 2 months later anyway, certainly others I've forgotten to mention. too many good talks in a short window).  

- President's debate. 
- Sebastian Schreiber's talk on resource allocation in stochastic environments
- Lizzie Wolkovich's talk on nonstationary climate and disparate impacts on phenology
- Robin Snyder's talk with beautiful reaction-diffusion approximation in ecology and evolutionary dynamics of marine mass spawners with correlated fates.
- Luke Mahler's talk on adaptive radiations
- Dick Golmuckwicz's talk, but also his stories over dinner; particularly about proving his own critque of a claim in Caswell's book wrong. Also some of his earlier work on functional / non-parametric approaches.   
- Time with the Mangel lab in Asilomar, of course.
