Still to do on figures:





	
  * Plots with and without skew/kurtosis -- DONE, enabled for Figure 1 & 2

	
  * Combine plots into full panels -- DONE for Figure 1 & Figure 2

	
  * separate plotting codes from analysis codes (at least whenever takes any computational effort/time to produce).  -- DONE

	
  * bootstrap_indicators should have option of which indicators are included -- DONE

	
  * all_indicators should have option of which indicators are included -- DONE

	
  * make tau_dist_montecarlo generic on type of indicator -- DONE

	
  * Repeat bootstrap of taus on the CaCO3 and Deut3 with LSN models -- RUNNING ([figure2.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/ecc42333f387c551dbead0c321a25d15108bc45f/warningsignals/demos/figure2.R))

	
  * Run montecarlotest of taus on LSN models for CaCO3 and Deut3 -- RUNNING ([figure3.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/c23980f2fd3fa8ba38cebf4f62b413e6a79532ac/warningsignals/demos/figure3.R))

	
  * Guess names for columns in list, if given -- DONE

	
  * Labels for outer-margins on panel plots -- DONE

	
  * Adjust bootstrap panel plots to use common y-axis height -- DONE



	
  * Need simulated data of stable system for Figures 1, 2,3 -- DONE



	
  * Select empirical-data examples -- DONE

	
  * Consider empirical-data without any signal?


Considering possible data-sets:

	
  * simulated dataset with loss of stability/degenerating environment: LTC example: load("5550863240.Rdat"), using LSN example now with stable and unstable examples.

	
  * simulated dataset without loss of stability, also showing positive signals -- DONE

	
  * simulated dataset with loss of stability, but showing no signal/negative correlation, not done, not sure if this is necessary to illustrate in Fig 1.

	
  * Empirical dataset showing positive correlations which we'll support in Figure 3, support with considerable uncertainty in Figure 2.  Deut3

	
  * Empirical dataset showing positive correlations which will appear spurious in Figure 3?

	
  * Examples that look at least a little more promising in Figure 2?
