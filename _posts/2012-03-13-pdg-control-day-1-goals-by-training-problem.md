## Training Problem I / Theme 1

### Policy costs

  1. Functional forms of cost & Structure of the paper
  2. Comparability (view over all costs? view expected economic benefit?)  
  3. Visualizations
  4. Dan's L1 norm story (vs stochastic, discrete time?)

#### Transaction Fee details in cts time, deterministic

### Advanced problem 1

How many spatially differentiated policies are optimal
 1. formulate bioeconomic model
 2. modularity methods
 3. comparison of GBR & Caribbean examples

## Training Problem 2 / Theme 2

Synthesis paper
Advanced problem II. 
 1. Functional forms for simulations, parameters, updating learning
 2. Vet different forms of uncertainty (vocab)
 3. Solve the simulations for model uncertainty: Adaptive management MPD, POMDP.
 4. POMDP & Outline manuscript.  

advanced Prob II on Allee.
