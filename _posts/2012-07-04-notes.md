## Value of information

* bias table with measurement noise
* Fix deterministic. 
* Run scenarios with very low noise rather than deterministic 
* Reed S vs. D theorem
* Reed theorem extended to Sethi cases
* simulation values should import scenario list. (done for bias table).  

### Reed theorem

* Not showing S = D for cost free.  hmm... 
* Not showing S constant for different profit functions?!


## impact of management on warning signals

Compare the probability of detection in managed and unmanaged models.  


**See pdg-control [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/issues) for details **

I'm trying to rely on the issues tracker to provide a more dynamic way to track progress than simply listing goals in the notebook. Hope to link these to the notebook through the Github API, ideally as static snapshots.  


## Evolution

* Evolution talk
* fishbase reply
* iEvoBio talk (rOpenSci)
