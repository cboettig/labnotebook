Writing
-------

- Working on / finishing up [slides](http://io.carlboettiger.info/pdg_control/presentation.html) for [ESA talk](http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/Session9683.html)
- and slides for [hastingsfest](http://hastingsfest.wordpress.com)


Exploring
---------

- Poking around a bit more in Docker yesterday, built some basic R containers for testing ropensci packages. [https://github.com/ropensci/docker-ubuntu-r/tree/master/add-r-ropensci](https://github.com/ropensci/docker-ubuntu-r/tree/master/add-r-ropensci) .  Somewhat skeptical but still curious about the potential (or the need) to publish a docker image as a reproducible research object.

- Attempted to add Travis builds to the Docker repo (just for fun, eh?), but appears Docker doesn't support the older kernel of 12.04

- Attempted an i386 build for the BCE, but no luck. [https://github.com/cboettig/collaboratool/blob/master/provisioning/BCE-14.04-i386.json](https://github.com/cboettig/collaboratool/blob/master/provisioning/BCE-14.04-i386.json)



Reading
-------

Fun [piece in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/aug/05/why-we-should-publish-less-scientific-research?CMP=twt_gu) from Digital Science manager Timo Hannay on the future of scientific publishing. I think (or choose to believe that) the thesis is at the end rather than in the title.
