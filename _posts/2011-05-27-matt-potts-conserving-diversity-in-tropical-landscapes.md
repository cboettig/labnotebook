My notes from Matt's seminar: Theory and field work addressing getting beyond binary decision making.  Malaysia.  Tropical forest becoming oil palm, rice, rubber, tea.


### Reserve Selection vs Landscape Reserve Design




### Optimality of Specialized vs Uniform Forest Management


Uniform (sustainable forest management) vs very protected areas, ignore what's done outside.  More intensive disturbance.

An important ecological nonlinearity: What's the most ubiquitous spatial pattern? Aggregated, random, uniform?  (50 hectares is .5 km by km, or 120 English acres, tag every tree taller than 1.3m [CTFS](http://www.ctfs.si.edu/), very nice spatial data).  [Also an [R package](http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/CTFS/html/00Index.html), though removed from cran]

((Aggregated? What about Jansen Connell? ))

For a fixed reserve area A, find the number of reserves (of size a) that maximizes the number m of species in the reserve: given that species are aggregated. (assume abundance distribution -- log-normal from Hubble (lots of rare species).  Neg Binomial model for aggregations.  (Assume a minimum viable population, ~100 individuals).

Sanity check cases: under random model, regardless of A, one large reserve is optimal.  Very aggregated, one large reserve is never optimal. Treats a two-step problem: economics tell you total area A, step 2: decide how to partition that.  (Springborn Question: when should you be doing step 1 conditional on step 2?)

_Conclusion_: as biodiversity is more valuable, fewer larger reserves is better.

Field study on VJR areas, no pattern on biodiversity.  hmm.

### Biodiversity Conservation challenges under REDD+


Key-issues:



	
  1. Additionality: No money to do what you already planned

	
  2. Baseline: Additional compared to what

	
  3. Leakage: Will this mean more logging elsewhere?

	
  4. Non-permanence

	
  5. Measurement

	
  6. Monitoring


Temporal & Spatial Scales of management: Biodiversity outside the timescale of typical lumber or carbon concerns. How about just RED?  Stack the biodiversity aspect, don't bundle it?
