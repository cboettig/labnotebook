title: Power in trees continues
---






 








Discussion of power in trees need a counterpoint to the example of the
star tree as being devoid of information content. The best example here
is probably the example tree used in the introduction of Felsenstein
1985: two star trees sharing a common ancestor. Implemented the basic
creation of a balanced tree of arbitrary depth having this structure.
The balanced tree has 2^*h*^ âˆ’ 1 nodes, all internal nodes occuring at
time = 1/2 and all tips at time = 1. This sets many branch lengths to
zero, which effectively turns a binary tree in an unresolved star.
Setting the time of all internal nodes to zero, the age of the root,
turns this into a star tree.
