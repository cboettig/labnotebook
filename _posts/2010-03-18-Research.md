-   A some point I'll want to think more seriously about incorporating
    geographic information into comparative analyses. At some level this
    data is more available than appropriate continuous traits, as
    illustrated in the [example phylogenetics
    wiki](http://iphylo.org/treebase/Doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2008.02.021 "http://iphylo.org/treebase/Doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2008.02.021")
    from Prof. Roderic Page that I just came across.

#### Today's Goals

-   Repeating last night's bootstraps on the likelihood ratio. Need to
    clean up and incorporate my bootstrap codes first.
-   Should also explore the bootstrapping of the partitioning functions
    from yesterday.
-   Begin implementing stochastic partitioning and stochastic ancestral
    state painting/inference.

#### Bootstrapping Likelihood ratios

Preliminary bootstrap of the likelihood ratios of the Anoles data (click
for larger). Red lines indicate where the true data falls.

Compare to the earlier bootstraps of likelihoods directly:
