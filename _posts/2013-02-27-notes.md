### Reviewing

arg, reviewing.  so much time.  

### Seminar

[Kate Richerson](http://katericherson.wordpress.com/) gave a fanstastic presentation to mega group yesterday showing her integration of behavior and dispersal in krill dynamics.  She derives the krill's behavioral movement patterns through a stochastic dynamic programming solution rather than just dictate it to the dispersal model directly.

- Provicative stuff in PNAS <span class="showtooltip" title="Perretti C, Munch S and Sugihara G (2013). Model-Free Forecasting
Outperforms The Correct Mechanistic Model For Simulated And
Experimental Data. _Proceedings of The National Academy of
Sciences_. ISSN 0027-8424, 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216076110."><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216076110">Perretti _et. al._ (2013)</a></span>.  It would be nice to see the comparison against the generating model.  The forecasting errors of the fully Bayesian inference using the correct model shouldn't necessary be small, but they should be just as big as the Bayesian model expects them to be (e.g. over replicates, the Bayesian forecast error reflects the widths of the posteriors (modulo some statement about priors)).

My worry with any approach doing better than the expected error is that it does so by generating biased estimation -- e.g. something in the forecasting method, rather than in the data, happens to be biased towards the 'right answer'.  In this example I don't think that is the case.

We already know that the modes of the posteriors don't recover the correct model parameters of the generating model from an MCMC of such a complex model with limited data (though perhaps it is good to remind folks of this!), so it is not surprising that a heuristic approach can outperform this in cases.  

It certainly is good to wrestle with these examples in any case.  Steve's one of my post-doc advisors now so no doubt I'm biased.  Noam also pointed out this earlier article in Ecology <span class="showtooltip" title="Perretti C, Sugihara G and Munch S (2012). Nonparametric
Forecasting Outperforms Parametric Methods For A Simulated
Multi-Species System. _Ecology_. ISSN 0012-9658,

- In seminar, Marc mentioned the great paper by <span class="showtooltip" title="Wiedenmann J, Cresswell K, Goldbogen J, Potvin J and Mangel M

Reading an old Schaffer paper <span class="showtooltip" title="Schaffer W (1984). Stretching And Folding in Lynx Fur Returns:
Evidence For A Strange Attractor in Nature? _The American
Naturalist_, *124*. ISSN 0003-0147, 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/284318."><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/284318" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Schaffer (1984)</a></span>.

- Though _Nature_ says the National Academy of Sciences needs an overhaul to stay relevant.  Probably true but they still do some excellent reports that could deserve more eyes, like this on model fitting (<span class="showtooltip" title="(????).

and Statistical Foundations of Verification, Validation, and

We could do more VVUQ in ecology and evolution, and the value of presenting benchmark examples of this in simple (trivial) cases cannot be overstated, e.g. Fig 5.2.1.

### Misc

* wrote a quick CSL format for knitcitations. (Generate inline citations using the copy function in Mendeley library.  A bit silly since normally that would already generate the entire bibliographic citation.)
* Should really make a CSL format for Mendeley to paste in a HTML citation (with full metadata in tooltip).   Might then use an existing format to copy-paste bib info at end.
