## Warning signals package





	
  * Reviewing [Numerical challenges](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1169) for faster analysis on warningsignals

	
  * created a quick [mcmcTools](https://github.com/cboettig/mcmcTools) package so different packages can use my custom routines.  Will have to explore some of the standard packages eventually, though most seem somewhat specialized (the Bayesian task-view is epic).  [bayesm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesm/index.html) looks promising, and LearnBayes package that accompanies Jim Albert's book (Albert, unknown) might be worth a closer look.

	
  * Wrote mcmc script for [warningsignals](https://github.com/cboettig/warningsignals), much more debugging to handle out-of-bounds conditions then expected.  Also switched to call parameters by position instead of name in linear_bifur_models.  Debugging is slow with slow codes!

	
  * illustrating how increasing the sampling rate increases power to determine necessary monitoring scheme:

  * Need to start writing more informative commit messages and committing more logically connected blocks with git.  Will perhaps go hand-in-hand with getting better with [fugitive plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975) for git commands in vim, for which [vimcasts has a nice tutorial](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/).
