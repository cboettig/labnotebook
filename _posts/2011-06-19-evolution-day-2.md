Second day of the conference.  Many of the talks I most want to see are coming up Monday and Tuesday, and I have a bit more to do to prepare my own talk, so I take it a bit light on sessions.  Highlight of the day was definitely the discussion with Mark McPeek and the other journal editors during and following the "Happy hour with the editors" session, which was perhaps the best event of the conference, despite a rather unimpressive attendance.  Apparently this is an annual tradition I missed last year, certainly hope not to miss it again.  Hope to flush out my reflections from those discussions sometime, meanwhile, just a few notes to myself below.

Haven't kept up with the paper notes, so using my own twitter archive to capture the essentials I wanted to remember or share from the talks I saw.  A bit of a cop-out but makes for quick collective note-taking.


## Talks





	
  * Stamatakis, Alexandros.  _What's new in RaxML?_

	
  * Crosby, Ralph: _Fast Evolutionary Tree Distance computation using quartets_

	
  * Linder, Randal: _SaTe-II, faster/more accurate simultaneous alignment and phylogenetic inference_

	
  * Zwickl, Derek: _A simple instertion-deletion mixture model for phylogenetic inference_


Lunch with Dan Rabosky, Graham Slater and others.

	
  * Chris Martin: _Beyond Ecological Opportunity: adaptive radiation and the origins of novel ecological niches_

	
  * Matt McGee: _Functional morphology and kinematics of feeding in stickleback: implications for ecological speciation_




## Happy Hour with The editors


(Am Nat, Evolution, JEB:)

Archiving code. double-blind review? who owns your review? Big names rejected more often from big journals. No one successfully guesses their reviewers.  Rejections are usually for failures of communication, not failures of scientific process.

Dinner with Liam Revell & Sam Price
