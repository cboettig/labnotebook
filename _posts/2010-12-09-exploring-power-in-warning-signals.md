Started trying to get the power curves for sample-size and rate of change.  Currently focusing on the transcritical bifurcation model.  This first pass uses just 100 replicates, which appears to be not nearly enough.  Need some troubleshooting on handling to get power curves out.  Scroll through, the set has 65 different images:

(code ids in image discription, compare to structured-popultions git log.  )

Includes plots of the timeseries, giving a visual clue of how dramatic the warning signal is under each case.
