* Finish and post core notes from yesterday.
* Debugging locale problem in phylo packages = success.  Emmanuel has already patched drop.fossils() in the ape package, will see if Gieger and TreeSim try to handle locale issue directly too.  Problem in comparisons:

```r
> Sys.setlocale(locale = "") # default locale using UTF8
 # message deleted
 > "-1" > 0
 [1] TRUE
 > Sys.setlocale(locale = "C")
 # message deleted
 > "-1" > 0
 [1] FALSE
```

  * Posted MCMCMC notes from algorithms.
  * Hastings Meeting 10-10:30
  * Wainwright lab meeting 2-3p: Chris discusses Cameroon Cichlids and evidence for sympatric speciation.  Also can measure age/stress/fitness by rings on fish scales.  wow.
  * Hastings lab meeting 3-4p: Matt discusses transition to policy from science.  Sandy Liebhold joins us for the chat.
  * Catch up on reading. Get better at citing reading in notebook for reference.


##### Today's reading
