-   Maximum likelihood assignment based on arbitrary number of
    partitions now completed. Working on stochastic assignment.
-   Now have functions for:

1.  partitioning data into k groups,
2.  inferring an ancestral state painting based on this partition
3.  inferring a continuous model with k OU regimes based on this
    painting

-   need to add my function for the proper model-comparison bootstrap of
    likelihood ratio values rather than the likelihoods themselves. See
    my original entry on this approach.

Currently running the bootstraps on the inferred models for two peaks
and three peaks compared to a single partition under either BM or OU.

As three peaks includes 2 peaks as a subset, it necessarily performs
better. However, the relative increase is much smaller. Comparing
likelihood ratios should help tease this apart further.

Wainwright Meeting
------------------

Discussed target papers for this research.

1.  Target a short paper focusing on the biological aspects of
    identifying two peaks in the Labrid data. Working on with Peter.
    Will probably add the three peak comparison (running now).
2.  Develop a commentary on phylogenetic signal and bootstrapping
    methods
3.  Full manuscript with the complete inference of multiple niches that
    integrates over uncertainty
