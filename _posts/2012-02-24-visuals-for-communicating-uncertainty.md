Visiting the question of communicating uncertainty in Marissa's lab meeting, focusing on this excellent Science article (Spiegelhalter _et. al._ 2011).  Noam and Jamie are leading the discussion, and suggested we pick a few favorite examples.  None on my list really address the challenge of communicating uncertainty directly, though the first one probably comes closest.  I think they do highlight some of the potential and the challenges of good data visualization though, which is certainly one of the essential building blocks to visual communication of uncertainty.

  * [Data journalism video from Stanford](http://datajournalism.stanford.edu), the best introduction I've seen, which hits upon some of the best-known examples.  
  * [Success and failure of data storytelling](http://flowingdata.com/2011/12/01/shan-carter-on-data-storytelling) Shan Carter, NY Times visualizations expert, gives a thought-provoking talk that leaves me wondering if we are asking too much of the visualization.  
  * [Animated graphics in R by SVG](http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/tests/examples.html), because easy and platform-independent interactive graphics are essential.  
  * [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/), because it's not a revolution until it's democratized.  
  * Tufte's [first book](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142), which sits above my desk.  

## the missing second block

(Spiegelhalter _et. al._ 2011) does a less excellent job addressing the some of the more basic problems in communicating uncertainty (though the conditional probability example comes close).  Uncertainty can be immensely counter-intuitive, as Mlodinow illustrates in one of my favorite [popular non-fiction books](http://www.amazon.com/Drunkards-Walk-Randomness-Rules-Lives/dp/0375424040).  He doesn't tackle visuals as a way of improving our intuition on the topic. I feel a proper treatment of the topic would start with some of the easily demonstrated fallacies around uncertainty Mlodinow discusses, and illustrate if and when visualizations can improve our accuracy.
