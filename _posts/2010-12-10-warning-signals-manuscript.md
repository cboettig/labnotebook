Meeting with Alan today to discuss outline.  Came up with basic break-down of paragraphs:



	
  1. Intro/Abstract

	
  2. Scope: Previous work, scope simple example existence of warning signal/CSD is clear.  Identifiability/Power not clear.  Mention the issue of Replicates

	
  3. Nonlinearity not observed with infinite data

	
  4. reasons detection fails: Identifiability issue & Power issue.  Example signal that exists but inadequate power to detect?

	
  5. Eigenvalue story

	
  6. Probability of data vs Probability of a statistic

	
  7. Simulation example

	
  8. Summarize results

	
  9. More knowledge of system help choose the right nonlinear model corresponding to the system.

	
  10. Conclusions


(Linear/nonlinear estimation analogous to parameterized estimation of tails of distribution vs non-par)

Theoretical mathematics question: Existence
Statistical Question: Identifiable, Power


## Continued progress


Setting up more exploratory simulations and writing.  Simulation speed is quite limiting at the moment.  May need to move likelihood calculations into C.


## OTher Notes


Some discussion of plans for a workshop on NSF data sharing.  Alan raises several good points:



	
  * Theoretical ecology policy should include a policy on code

	
  * How about large data-sets separate from publications, i.e. NEON?
