Hmm, interesting reading mentioned on the SWC thread:

[Philip Gao on "Two Cultures of Computing"](http://www.pgbovine.net/two-cultures-of-computing.htm)

Yet I think the answer is simple.  The user culture (GUI culture) is about what computers can do.  The programmer-culture (unix culture) is about what they can't do -- yet.  Unix is like a box of legos -- you can reassemble the blocks into just about anything you can imagine.  The students are pointing to pre-built, permanently glued together finished products.  Yeah, they look more like what is on the cover of the lego box than the pile of bricks inside.  But that's not why kids buy Lego.
