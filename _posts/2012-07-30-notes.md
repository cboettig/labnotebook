#### Value of information

Exploring causes for deviation from `S = D` in the Reed model: arises from self-sustaining assumption. Working out the interpretation of the self-sustaining clause, which sounds like it needs to ensure that the stock is non-decreasing in the absence of harvest,

$$ P(X_{t+1} \geq x  | X_n = x ) = 1 $$

This sounds like a very awkward condition to enforce for a non-trivial escapement level \\( x = S \\). Why should the population be guarenteed to increase from it's escapement population size?   


Given the definition


$$ X_{t+1} = Z_t f(X_t) $$

and the condition that we have to have 

$$ \operatorname{E}(Z_t f(X_t) ) = f(X_t) $$

that is, $ Z_t $ has to be mean unity, then some shocks must result in 

$ X_{t+1} \leq f(X_t) $

for any non-trivial $Z_t$. So how do we enforce that these decreases do not violate the self-sustaining principle?  
It would seem to require at least that $Z_t$ is a function of $X$  as well?

Reed seems to imply that this is a much more trivial requirement, such as stating only that $f(x)$ is compensating density dependence (such as Beverton Holt), and not overcompensating (such as the discrete logistic).
