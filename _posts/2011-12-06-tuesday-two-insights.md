## Control & Optimization




### Dominique Bonvin visit





	
  * two-step control (optimize parameters, optimize mean-square error between model and measurement also by parameter adjustment) fails when reality isn't in the model set.  Problem is under-determined (N free variables, 4N equations).  (converges, but onto the wrong optimum).

	
  * Better solution -- adjust the penalty/regularization terms to to get better agreement between model and data

	
  * Bonvin approach -- adjust the control instead (NCO Control).  Can be almost model free in the control process.   (**)




### pdg-control Training Problem 1b & 2





	
  * Coded SDP with costs to changing quotas.



	
  * Best way to visualize the optimal solution?




## Evolution





	
  * Hessian calculation?  Non-trivial -- how to get Hessian from a non-gradient method, or a gradient method when you need to handle bounds?  Various numerical challenges.



	
  * Wrightscape model comparisons -- comparing meaningful hypotheses! (**)
