## Today's log





	
  * Edited cover letter summary for public.

	
  * Soliciting feedback on examples in manuscript vs appendix, see [Monday's entry](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1408).  (Entry posted, images added to flickr database)

	
  * Jeff fixed the double-post bug in twitteR, [tested update](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1361).

	
  * Improved initialization estimates for LSN model in fit_models ([code](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/commit/b11f4392519f98a466c37b2cf5e9d4819965a232)), as identified & discussed in [Sunday's entry.](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1389) Needs testing on a unit case, trying on ibm_analysis.R now... [ seems to work fine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cboettig/5614310030/).

	
  * Running [this ibm_analysis ](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/commit/2b85b0e24faa478b284ee261a287ba03759182f7)on a small dataset at 2000 replicates (zero, nice 19).

	
  * Model choice sets ([i.e. see in stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cboettig/5613555396/in/photostream)) finally finished -- but some trouble in corresponding data records to the figures??

	
  * Reworking model section of appendix, consider Levins-style model in place of traditional logistic as the transcritical bifurcation.

  * Flushed out appendix discussion of Cox's delta.

	
  * Adding data descriptions to appendix.

	
  * Updates to appendix examples: Skew (pull out kurtosis, never really proposed/applied).

	
  * Model generality comments




## To Do





	
  * Text: adjust to reflect a single Figure.  Adjust captions.  adjust to reflect Algae example.

	
  * Specify which Glaciation example, specify data treatments
Specify which Algae example

	
  * Examples: Remove kurtosis examples.  Add IBM examples with sufficient and insufficient power.

	
  * R package and examples cleanup

	
  * Update parameter estimates without convergence failure runs.

	
  * Review remaining comments
