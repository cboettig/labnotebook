An excellent question came up on ecoinformatics list today on data citation from Kyle Kwaiser at the Michigan Biological Station



> I am working with graduate students this summer to archive their work at our field station. I want to tell them to cite their datasets on their CV's but I know this is not yet the norm.

Any general thoughts on how close we are to including datasets on CV's? Can you suggest recent papers that argue (decisively) for this practice? Here are two relevant but slightly tangential examples:

- Reichman, O. J., M. B. Jones, and M. P. Schildhauer. 2011. “Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology.” Science 331 (6018) (February): 703-705.
- Vision, Todd J. 2010. “Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing.” BioScience 60 (5) (May): 330-331.


I gave a look over my Mendeley archives on the topic to come up with a few more. As this question seemed of interest to the FriendFeed groups ((yeah, so I was probably supposed to post this in G+, but not everyone can access that yet, right?)) I thought I'd take the liberty to share there. Unfortunately comments can't be formatted, so I'm adding my list here. Tried to include the relevant quote from the article unless that would mean quoting the whole thing. Will try and polish a bit later.
