- Returned proofs for warning signals paper.
- Wrightscape figures sent to Peter.
- move `fallacy` to a branch off of main in `earlywaring` package?
- Running knit on the large clusters means images cannot be uploaded as they are created, since compute nodes don't have internet access.  Saving files locally, I've created [a little script](https://github.com/cboettig/sandbox/blob/master/uploadflickr) to parse the output `file.md` to find the and upload the local images, and swap the local paths for the url paths.
- Also wrote quick R [script to build the corresponding bib files](https://github.com/cboettig/sandbox/blob/master/bibgen) from a markdown file with pandoc style citations. 

## Misc
- Minor tweaks on new site.
- Annoyed by [Mathjax/markdown issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10438937/is-there-a-markdown-parser-supported-on-jekyll-that-plays-nicely-with-mathjax). [Redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet/issues/130). Maruku does better, protecting anything in `$$`, but lacks support for fenced code blocks.  They are supposed to work on [this fork](https://github.com/nex3/maruku/issues/28#issuecomment-5499698), but no luck.  UPDATE -- problem solved, I can just wrap any mathjax expressions in a `<div>` `</div>` and they'll work with any markdown interpreter.  
- UC considers an [open-access policy](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2012/05/draft-of-proposal-for-uc-openaccess.html), now open for comments.  (Email Brian Kolner, we may get a statement from the GSA giving a student perspective on this one).
