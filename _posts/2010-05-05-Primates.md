-   Primates project now has a [Github
    repository](http://github.com/cboettig/sandbox "http://github.com/cboettig/sandbox").
    Updates are embedded from here.

-   Experimenting with distributing code and data effectively. Pluses
    and minuses of three options:

1.  zipped file with R code and data. Requires setting working
    directory, harder to update. Subsequent uploads must include all the
    data, rather than incremental.
2.  Directly grab repository over github. Simple to update and access,
    stores only incremental changes. Requires knowledge of git
3.  R package: Nicely integrates data, code, and documentation. Requires
    installing R packages.

-   Learning the R packaging system for data. You can have .R files in
    the data/ directory of a package. The call to the data() function
    runs those files from that directory, making it unnecessary to
    specify the path to the data and allowing the use of complicated
    functions, see the example from the ape package:

~~~~ {.de1}
require(ape, quietly = TRUE, save = FALSE)
bird.orders <- read.tree("bird.orders.tre")

Primate Phylogeny
-----------------

**Carl Boettiger 00:37, 30 April 2010 (EDT)**:

-   Simon sent me the tree data from their paper:

1.  [Chatterjee HJ, Ho SY, Barnes I, and Groves C.
    .](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?cmd=prlinks&dbfrom=pubmed&retmode=ref&id=19860891 "View or buy article from publisher (if available)")
    pmid:19860891.
    [PubMed](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&rettype=abstract&id=19860891 "PMID 19860891")
    [HubMed](http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?uids=19860891 "PMID 19860891")
    [primates]

-   This is the first calibrated ultrametric tree I've been able to
    couple to the primate data Daniel provided. I've preformed a quick
    ancestral state reconstruction on log brain weight (warmer colors
    are more massive).

### R code to create figure

~~~~ {.de1}
library(ape)
library(geiger)
genera_set <- read.nexus("mt.genera.ucld.trees")
nuc_set <- read.nexus("nuc.ucld.trees")
genera <- genera_set[[1]]
nuc <- nuc_set[[1]]
nuc_names <- nuc$tip.label
genera_names <- genera$tip.label
traits <- read.csv("Primate_brain_comparisons.csv")
 
dups <- duplicated(traits[['Genus']])
trait_names <- as.character(traits$Genus[!dups])
x <- traits$log_brain.weight[!dups]
names(x) <- trait_names
 
 
compare <- treedata(nuc, x)
plot(compare$phy)
out <- ace(compare$data, compare$phy)
 
# a similar function but for the continuous ancestral state 
plot_cts_ancestor <- function(phy, data, ancestral){  
    plot(phy) # just to get treelength 
    treelen <- max(axisPhylo() )
    plot(compare$phy, cex=1, x.lim=1.3*treelen, edge.width=2)
    mycol <- function(x){
    tmp = (x - min(data)) /max(x-min(data)) 
    rgb(blue = 1-tmp, green=0, red = tmp )
    }
    nodelabels(pch=19, col=mycol(ancestral$ace), cex=1.5  )
    tiplabels(pch=19, col=mycol(data), cex=1.5, adj=0.5) # add tip color code
    }
plot_cts_ancestor(compare$phy, compare$data, out)
~~~~

-   This is essentially just at the proof of concept level. A couple
    obvious steps:

1.  This uses a single tree from the posterior distribution of trees,
    which we'll eventually want to average over in the parameter
    estimation. Meanwhile should use a consensus MLE tree instead.
2.  Trees are resolved to genus level, so traits should be genus
    averages (instead of subsamples).
3.  Ancestral state reconstruction under the Brownian Motion model is
    the most preliminary treatment, will certainly be interesting to
    consider the various multi-peak OU models and identify potential
    transitions between peaks, as well as power analysis for the model
    fits.
4.  Multidimensional trait inference should also be interesting

-   Possible bug? The Homo/Pan and Gorilla/Pan nodes would be expected
    to be in the Gorilla/Pan colour rather than the Homo colour.
