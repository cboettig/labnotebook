title: Solution to the strange behavior in ouch
---






 








Looks like my troubles actually stem from a bug in the code. I summarize
the problem here, just as I posted in my query to R sig phylo.
Essentially the program erroneously squares alpha at the moment,
explaining the pattern I found yesterday. Giving it root alpha
preemptively should be a good work around.

\

~~~~ {.de1}
data(bimac)
tree <- with(bimac,ouchtree(node,ancestor,time/max(time),species))
print(h2 <- hansen(log(bimac['size']),tree,bimac['OU.1'],alpha=1,sigma=1))
~~~~

The print command says alpha = 0.1921554 The call h2@alpha says alpha =
.4383554

which is the sqrt of the other. Certainly these should all agree. The
summary command agrees with the print command:

~~~~ {.de1}
smry = summary(h2)
smry$alpha
~~~~

A little exploration seems to show that the print command is the correct
one. If we want to simulate a model with a particular alpha value, we
first have to generate a fitted model as above, then update the alpha
value and call simulate on the fitted model. I believe ouch is
accidentally squaring the value of alpha we give it before running the
simulation. For example:

~~~~ {.de1}
> h2@alpha = 5
> replicates <- as.data.frame(simulate(h2, 1000))
</syntax>
 
I find the expected variance by averaging the variance across the replicates,
 
<syntaxhighlight>
> mean(sapply(1:1000, function(i){var(replicates[i], na.rm=T)} ) )
[1] 0.0009774488
~~~~

So did it use 5 or 25 as the alpha value? Since either value is large
compared to the length of the tree, the tip variance should be
stationary independent of tree structure so we can check it against the
analytic predicted variance (sigma\^2/2 alpha):

~~~~ {.de1}
> (h2@sigma)^2/(2*h2@alpha)
[1] 0.004836469
> (h2@sigma)^2/(2*(h2@alpha)^2)
[1] 0.0009672938
~~~~

As the second equation agrees with the simulation, it believe that ouch
has erroneously squared the value of alpha in the simulation.

Limits to Power in Trees
------------------------

Now that I'm sure I can compare apples to apples (matching stationary
distributions), I can finally perform my intended comparison.

-   First, confirm that the distributions generated by the models on the
    star tree are indistinguishable:

-   Next, the same models are distinguishable on the Felsenstein Tree:

![Image:Fels\_tree\_likelihoods.png](http://openwetware.org/images/1/18/Fels_tree_likelihoods.png)

Here α = 1 and σ = 3

-   **Intuition at the moment:** The longer the two branches before the
    polytome in the Felsenstein tree, the more powerful the tree will
    be. More precisely, we can ask what is the smallest value of alpha
    that can be reliably distinguished from BM on this particular tree?
    That answer should be proportional to how close the variances of two
    branches can get to their stationary values, 1 − *e*^−\\ 2α*s*^
    where *s* is the branch length, 0.9 in this case, giving us 83% of
    the way to the equilibrium.

-   Compare moving the branch points from t=0.9 to t=0.45 vs halving
    alpha:

![Image:Weaker.png](http://openwetware.org/images/3/3a/Weaker.png)

Both show an roughly equal reduction on the discriminatory power, and
the ability to discriminate between models is lost.

\

-   On the flip size, we can increase the power by doubling alpha from 1
    to 2,

![Image:Stronger.png](http://openwetware.org/images/4/4c/Stronger.png)

\

-   Still need to explore the effect of simply increasing the length of
    time in the entire tree, doesn't match doubling alpha. Increasing
    alpha also tightens the distribution, so reaching the stationary
    distribution along the branch isn't enough.

Have started using [google style guidelines for
R](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html "http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html")
code. Will also be implementing [google style for
C](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml "http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml").
