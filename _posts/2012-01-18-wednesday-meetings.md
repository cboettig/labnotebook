#### Troubleshooting S3 and S4


Try adding methods? Changing order on NAMESPACE?

Leaving ouch off the import list: no errors, but within functions, don't get S4 method. import but don't depend on ouch: error.  accurate, since simulate is left as an s3 function at the user level.

What a headache.  See [stackQ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8884607/r-using-s3-and-s4-methods-of-simulate-in-the-same-package).

Detecting release of constraint through phylogenetic methods


* Figure 1: cartoon of the difference between the release of constraint and the brownie model.
* Figure 2: Traits (Peter)
* Figure 3: regimes phylogeny
* Figure 4: Flow diagram of the model choice process
* Figure 5: Figure Model choice, <-- must be intuitive!
* Figure 6: panel Figure for parameters.  <- barplot


## And back to Work...

* pmc fixed, maybe?  Vignette needs expanded explanations and simpler syntax, plus figure fixed.
* Evolution post?
