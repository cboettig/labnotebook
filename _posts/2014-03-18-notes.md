ropensci
--------

- Ensuring interoperability in R / ropensci projects. See pre-hackathon discussion: [ropensci/hackathon/issues/#20](https://github.com/ropensci/hackathon/issues/20)
- `rfigshare` to use new oauth interface of `httr`, see [rfigshare/#72](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/72)
- Ugh. More fun with travis integration on `RNeXML` [RNeXML/#61](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/61)

pdg-control / policycosts
-------------------------

- Started tidying up this repo's manuscript folder a bit.  
- Merge Paul's various changes on tex and Word documents into Rmd
