I'd like to highlight that this panel was assembled and moderated by graduate students, where it was featured as part of the campus-wide graduate student research symposium.  The changing requirements have a much more apparent impact on faculty writing grants and charged with the overall management of a project than they do on students. Yet here are the students bringing together librarians, digital data archiving specialists, technology transfer directors, and professors of law, and the faculty that have been at the forefront of these issues -- to talk about the issues in such a community forum.  

Nearly every discussion of these issues have raised the need to address social and cultural challenges to data sharing (_e.g._  (Reichman _et. al._ 2011), (Tenopir _et. al._ 2011)).  Forums such of these offer an excellent chance to start addressing these issues head-on.  I hope other universities will hold similar panels with their local experts to carry these discussions forward.  This video recording is archived on [uctv](http://uctv.tv).
