## Scratch notes


One-at-a-time sensitivity: (OAT), instead of exhaustive combinations (Latin hypercube)

VV

Validation: are we solving the equations correctly
Verification: are we solving the correct equations


UQ: Uncertainty Quantification


Using a particular scenario (double C02) -> a PDF
Different models -> different PDFs

What are the nobs, what are the ranges?

Spread in a single model greater than spread across model means...
