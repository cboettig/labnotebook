Following up after yesterday's meeting, I am working on implementing the
confidence interval analysis and quantifying information in trees. This
second point I will develop by comparing the Felsenstein example tree
(information-rich) to the star tree (uninformative), and develop this
discussion in the context of assessing the importance of phylogenetic
corrections and phylogenetic intertia (my original theme again: noise or
data??).

Primate Brain Morphometry
-------------------------

Daniel Mietchen contacted me through openwetware 11 days ago with
interest in applying phylogenetic comparative methods to Primate Brain
Morphometry data. The initial [data
spreadsheet](/images/2/23/Primate_brain_comparisons.xls "Primate brain comparisons.xls")
includes 2 continuous traits for 61 Primate species. To get rolling on
this in the comparative methods framework, I'll first need to create or
find a decent ultrametric tree and then will be up and running. This
should both help Dan and be a good experimental dataset for me, which
I'll be exploring more during my time at the [Bodega Phylogenetics
Workshop](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/ "http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/")
March 6-13.
