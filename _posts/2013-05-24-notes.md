### nonparametric-bayes

Demonstrating robustness of the GP approach is remarkably difficult
ironically because the comparison methods are not particularly robust;
most often due to poor initial conditions.  Doing all I can to make the
MLE and parametric Bayesian cases suitably automated such that the can
give reasonable performance as I loop over various simulation parameters
and models without much hand-holding of each of the estimators.

Also an automatic sensitivity analysis gets pretty computationally
intensive and generates a lot of different outputs to keep track of,
trying to improve this through cleaner code, parallelization, caching,
chunk dependencies, and namespaces for scripts.

* Playing with mcmc convergence over initial conditions
* Running case without measurement error for parametric bayesian models
* Adaptuing runs for parallel and for execution on farm cluster
* Consider ADMB for the MLE estimate to be a bit more robust for automated cases.
