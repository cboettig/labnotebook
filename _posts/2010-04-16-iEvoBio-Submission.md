### Quantifying Information in a Phylogenetic Tree: The Robustness of Phylogenetic Signal

Since Felsenstein (1985)’s influential paper on phylogenetic contrasts,
phylogenetically-based inferences of evolutionary patterns have gotten
increasingly more complex (Hansen, 1997; Butler and King, 2004;
Freckleton and Harvey, 2006; O’Meara et al., 2006; Pagel and Meade,
2006). More and more sophisticated models are applied to datasets of
species mean traits on a phylogenetic tree in an attempt to answer such
questions as reconstructing ancestral states, identify changes in rates
of character evolution across time and across clades, identify the
number and location of evolutionary optima or the strength of
stabilizing selection. In each of these analyses, an ultrametric
phylogenetic tree is the only source of temporal information to quantify
these intrinsically temporally-based questions.

The extent to which a phylogenetic tree can reliably shed light into the
evolution of traits in the past depends not only on its size but on its
structure. For instance, an unresolved or star phylogeny contains no
information and renders phylogenetic techniques uninformative,
regardless of the number of taxa. While the question of phylogenetic
signal is not new (Price, 1997; Losos, 1996), there has been
insufficient analysis of when a phylogenetic signal is substantial
enough to inform the kinds of inferences we now routinely perform.

I will present examples of how typical phylogenetic analyses are applied
to trees that are insufficiently informative to choose between models. I
will discuss ways to detect and quantify the power of a phylogenetic
tree relative to common methods. I will introduce an actively developing
open source software package for addressing these issues. In the spirit
of the conference, this research and code are being developed and
released in the open under GPL-v3.0 and Creative Commons by-sa licenses.
