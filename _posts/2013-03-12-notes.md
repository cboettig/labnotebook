### Monday


* multiple_uncertainty abstract
* Meeting with Robin Snyder
* application writing


### Tuesday

#### Morning

* applications
* Coordinating summer conference travel
* ropensci proposals
* EML is not an ontology, not analgous to Dublin Core, etc. Just an XML schema.  see [OBOE](https://semtools.ecoinformatics.org/oboe) for an ecological ontology.  to explore later.  

### Afternoon 

#### multiple-uncertainty

* Revisiting multiple-uncertainty runs.  Running smaller table example.  Recoded script to allow arbitrary set of noise configurations to be consistently compared.  
* Some debugging.  Shared-memory parallelization prohibitive at current memory requirements.  
* See: small table example (for issue #3) [04:48 pm 2013/03/12](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/commit/a2806b079faf60ac1537e3dc8f129b79aab826f0)

#### nonparametric-bayes

* Exploring options for approximate dynamic programming.  For the moment, working through the basic ADP algorithm presented in Powell (2006).  
* in-progress notes: [latest version](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/blob/master/inst/examples/adp-intro.md) [version-stable link](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/blob/dc45de162b057a1eb53846e030354a02305c9ea5/inst/examples/adp-intro.md)
