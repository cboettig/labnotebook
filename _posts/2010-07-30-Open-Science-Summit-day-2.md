---






 








Full day (really -- no breaks, lunch served during talks) of talks at

Amazingly well web-captured conference, in addition to streaming on
fora.tv, [complete
transcripts](http://gnusha.org/transcripts/open-science-summit-2010/ "http://gnusha.org/transcripts/open-science-summit-2010/")
of talks are available thanks to someone with fast fingers.

Also through the back-channel, particularly the links it shares:
