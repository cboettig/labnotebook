## warning-signals

* Working on revisions for [ews-review](https://github.com/cboettig/ews-review/)
* Grr, the challenges of open science -- can't stick confidential reviews in ews-review repo where they belong, or track them on the issues tracker, without disclosing their contents.  What are the terms of use for these things anyhow>  

## phylogentics / pmc

* Apparently pmc does have users -- at least one recognized that my Vignette is broken following the latest Gieger update.  Need to add simulate and update methods for the new fitContinuous, and then integrate these. [pmc/#3](https://github.com/cboettig/pmc/issues/3)
* Another pmc request. Sounds like I should also add support for OUwie fits.  See if I can get Jeremy to add `simulate` and `update` methods.  [pmc/#4](https://github.com/cboettig/pmc/issues/4)

> __Dear phylogeneticists__: please define a methods API for your functions.  Accessing coefficients using something like `output[[1]][[2]]$somevar$name[4]` is not only cumbersome, but bound to break when you modify your function, so provide a `coef` method. Likewise provide `simulate` and `update` methods so we can all raise the bar on our statistics a little bit.  

Alternatively put the code on Github, where sensible folks can fork it, add some common-sense classes and give you a pull request.  


## Code tricks

Because I'm always wondering how to do this one: let's see what methods are defined for Geiger's new `gfit` class:

```r
methods(class="gfit")
```

Returns: 

```r
[1] coef.gfit*   logLik.gfit*

   Non-visible functions are asterisked
```

ht Michael Hannon for that one, and a good way to confuse some folks on [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16048949). 


## knitcitations

* Fixed a minor issue in tooltip formatting, [knitcitations/#37](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/issues/37). Unfortunately not updated in earlier notebook entires, but should be fixed from here on).  
* Interesting ideas from some folks about adding CSL support, and thinking about being able to pull data into knitcitations from personal zotero libraries, [knitcitations/#38](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations/issues/38).  Zotero API seems to have some nice features for listing entries of a collection in a variety of file formats, including CSL styling for the returns.  
* Nearly a month since last push (0.4-4). Should update CRAN to current development version (0.4-6) sometime this week...

## Reading

* The debates continue: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1301759110" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Szuwalski (2013)</a> , and the reply <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1302181110" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Vert-pre _et. al._ (2013)</a> , reflecting confusion over the article earlier this year, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1214879110" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Vert-pre _et. al._ (2013b)</a> .  

* Disupting the claim of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044486" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Ditlevsen & Johnsen (2010)</a>  and others, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-323-2013" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" >Cimatoribus _et. al._ (2013)</a>  argue that DO events do show warning signals.  But are they chance transitions then?  

* Looking over <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1143" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsAuthority" >Lenton (2011)</a> , which has a review of some of the evidence against warning signals for noise-induced transitions.  

* An even earlier result from Ludwig, in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1017070" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" >Ludwig (1975)</a> .
