Going several directions at once in tweaking the warning signals code to make sure I have clear comparisons that are not resulting from any limitations in the numerical algorithms.Â  Performing a variety of error checks, etc:



	
  * Comparing fixed models vs comparing models estimated from the data

	
  * Ensure that const model doesn't attempt to estimate m (doesn't impact likelihood anyway

	
  * Ensure only positive values of sigma are returned (trying use trigger in setLTC and setLSN to return infinite variance if sigma is negative)

	
  * tau distributions compare totally separate null and test models, rather than ones both estimated from the same dataset.
