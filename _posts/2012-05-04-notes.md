## Chris Costello Talk
Presents unpublished work on value of (behavioral) adaptation, using forestry practices changing under climate change as the example.  __If we ignore adaptive responses, we overestimate costs and underestimate benefits.__

- Effect w/ adaptation:

$$ \frac{d V}{d \theta} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \frac{\partial r }{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} $$

- Envelope theorem: optimal point is at <span>\( df/dr = 0 \)</span>, so no value of adaptation after optimizing with respect to r. 
- Present Faustman harvest model adding with heterogeneity on site, species, time, age, environment to dynamic programming solution. 

## meeting
- Discuss @Sethi2005 and @Brozovic2011
- Option value pricing on acting on an early warning signal?
- Discussion of adding 

## lunch
- Fascinating discussion of his experience in the marine reserve design process, in which they use a model to score proposals offered by stakeholders but are forbidden using the model to predict the optimal policy (since they are then more directly accountable for the recommendation). 

## Wrightscape

- Should we present the additional traits that do not show a signal, for contrast?
- Launched additional runs on `farm` cluster, each on 16 cores, running over all traits:
