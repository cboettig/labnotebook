Algorithms group today took a brake from discussing algorithms for an aside on coding practices.  Today we focused primarily on literate programming tools for making better documented, more readable code.   We covered:



	
  * [Sweave](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~charlie/Sweave/)

	
  * [Google style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html), also see R core-team developer Hadley Wickam's[ style guide](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Style) (modified from Google)

	
  * R coding practices grab-bag: using functionalized code, {...}, S3 vs S4 classes.

	
  * [roxygen](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen/), [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)


Next time: Github, then we'll spend 30 minutes collaboratively adding roxygen documentation to our existing codes and committing changes over git.
