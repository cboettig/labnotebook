**editorial note**: These notes pre-date the formal start of my online
laboratory notebook, [Feb 2 2010: The Lab Notebook Goes Open](http://carlboettiger.info/2010/02/02/The-Lab-Notebook-Goes-Open-.html)
and were adapted from a LaTeX document in which I kept notes on this topic
during my summer at [IIASA](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/).  Lacking a proper notebook then, documents
like this one were updated periodically and occassionally branched into
new ones.  The post date represents the last time the 
LaTeX document was edited in the course of that research. 


-----------------------------------------

We wish to establish the fate of a population into which a rare mutant
is introduced near a branching point. Far from the branching point, we
had only one concern – will the mutant survive? Near the branching
point, we now have two concerns – the fate of the mutant and the fate of
the original resident. For branching to proceed, both must persist. The
traditional framework of density-independent diffusion theory is
insuffient to handle this case. We must consider both resident and
mutant populations, with abundances $N_1$ and $N_2$ respectively. Under
a series of approximations, we can again write this case as a one
dimensional equation in the frequency of the mutant, $p$; however, this
time the equation will necessarily be nonlinear to have an additional
intermediate stable state $0<p<1$ in addition to the boundaries $p=0$
and $p=1$. We briefly review the necessary approximations as an
understanding of them is essential to develop the proper picture.

While the argument could be expressed in greater generality of generic
birth and death rates, working with our particular example is
instructive. For a dimorphic population, the master equations governing
the probability distributions are:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} P(N_1,t) &= (\mathbb{E}_1 - 1) r N_1 \frac{N_1 + C(x_1, x_2) N_2}{K(x_1) }P(N_1) + (\mathbb{E}_1^{-1} - 1)r N_1 P(N_1) \nonumber \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} P(N_2,t) &= (\mathbb{E}_2 - 1) r N_2 \frac{N_2 + C(x_2, x_1) N_1}{K(x_2) }P(N_2) + (\mathbb{E}_2^{-1} - 1)r N_2 P(N_2),
\label{mastereq}\end{aligned}$$

where $E_i^k$ is the step operator taking $f(N_i) \to f(N_{i+k})$. We
apply van Kampen’s expansion of the master equation to linear order in
the system size $K_0$, the carrying capacity at the singular strategy.
While several other options are possible, it is important to note that
this approximation, which gives rise to a diffusion equation, is *not*
based on the assumption of a large *population* size, but a large
*system* size. Confusing the two is common in the literature. For
instance, if the system size is an area, then the transformed variable
that obeys the diffusion equation is the density of individuals (a
naturally continuous quantity), not the number of individuals, and the
approximation becomes better when larger areas are considered, not
larger numbers in the same area (which just means a higher density).
Having stated this, we take $n_i = N_i/K_0$ and apply the expansion to
recover the following stochastic differential equation (Itô expression)

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}n_1 = r n_1 \left(1 -  \frac{n_1 + C(x_1, x_2) n_2}{K(x_1) } \right) \mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{K_o} } \sqrt{r n_1 \left(1 +  \frac{n_1 + C(x_1, x_2) n_2}{K(x_1) } \right) } \mathrm{d}W_1
\label{sde}\end{aligned}$$

and $n_2$ similarly. This approximation is rigorously justified in the
limit $K_0 \to \infty$. The next approximation is only heuristically
justified at the moment, changing variables into $p = n_1/(n_1+n_2)$.
The approximation makes two assumptions which are not strictly valid but
justifable under the right conditions. The first is that the total
population size is a constant, $n_1 + n_2 = n$. Even at stationary
state, this is not valid as the populations fluctuate according to , but
these fluctuations become negligible for large $K_0$. However, the
system is only near stationary state when $p$ is at it’s equilibrium
value – it is not valid for all $p$. This is more problematic, as the
resulting SDE will depend only on $k_1$ and not $k_2$. Only when
$k_1 = k_2$ is this equation valid for any value of $p$. If mutational
steps are small this will be approximately true. As we will see, smaller
mutational steps will require larger populations and/or tighter
competition kernels for branching to occur at all. Simplying notation by
$C(x_1, x_2) = C_{1,2}$ and $K(X_i) = k_i$, this gives us the
one-dimensional nonlinear SDE in the frequency $p$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}p = r p \left(1 -  n \frac{p + c_{1,2}(1-p) }{k_1 } \right) \mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{\sqrt{K_o n} } \sqrt{r p \left(1 +  n\frac{p + c_{1,2} (1-p) }{k_1 } \right) } \mathrm{d}W_1\end{aligned}$$

The extinction probability $u(p,t)$ for this expression is given by the
Backwards equation for the generator,

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) = r p \left(1 -  n \frac{p + c_{12}(1-p) }{k_1 } \right) \partial_p u(p,t) + \frac{1}{2K_o n } r p \left(1 +  n\frac{p + c_{12} (1-p) }{k_1 } \right) \partial_p^2 u(p,t) 
\label{u}$$

with the boundary conditions $u(0) = 1$ and $u(1) = 1$ being absorbing.

After some rearrangement we can rewrite this as

$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) = \left( rp \left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right) - \frac{r n}{k_1} p^2 (1 - c_{12} )\right)  \partial_p u(p,t) \\
+ \left( rp \left(1+\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1}\right)  + \frac{r n }{k_1} p^2 (1 - c_{12} ) \right) \frac{\partial_p^2 u(p,t)}{2K_0 n}\end{gathered}$$

Note then for $p$ small we can neglect the terms quadratic in $p$ and we
are left with the backwards equation from the density independent case,

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} u(p,t) =  rp \left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right)   \partial_p u(p,t) + rp \left(1+\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1}\right)   \frac{\partial_p^2 u(p,t)}{2K_0 n}$$

Setting equal to zero we have a simple ordinary differential equation
for the stationary extinction probability:

$$\begin{aligned}
u &= 1 - e^{-2sp K_0 n} \\
s &= \frac{r\left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right) }{ r\left(1+\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1}\right)} \end{aligned}$$

and particularly for a frequency $p$ corresponding to a single
individual, a frequency of
$p=1/(N_1+N_2) =(1/K_0)/(n_1+n_2) = 1/(K_0 n)$, this reduces to

$$u = 1-e^{-2s}$$

Assuming $ rp \left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right) \neq 0$, the
time-dependent solution is:

$$\begin{aligned}
u &= 1-e^{-p \psi(t) } \\
\psi(t) &= \frac{2 s K_0 n}{1-e^{ r\left( 1-\frac{n c_{12}}{k_1} \right) t } }
\label{timedep}\end{aligned}$$

This tells us nothing about the survival of the resident. In most
applications of this approach, it is assumed the resident quickly goes
extinct once $p \sim o(1)$. If we consider the asymptotic behavior of
the nonlinear PDE, Eq. , we find not suprisingly that the asymptotic
behavior is sure absorbtion at one boundary or the other. The asymptotic
behavior needn’t concern us; as we really want to know how the expected
lifetime of this dimporphic state compares with the rate at which
mutants are entering this population. To do so we need the time
dependent solution to the nonlinear equation .

This poses some trouble in choosing $p = 1/(nK_0)$ as the initial mutant
frequency. In the linear case, this always canceled perfectly with the
noise term, $nK_0$, leaving a fixation probability that did not depend
on the population size (system size), given that it was large enough to
justify the linear noise approximation in the first place. This is no
longer the case. Larger populations result in the mutant frequency $p$
being much smaller. While the noise also decreases, we do not observe
the perfect balance of the linear system. While an analytic,
time-dependent solution for $u$ in this case is not possible, numerical
solutions illustrate the much smaller populations having significantly
higher survival probability, due to the higher value of $p$ from which
they start given a single mutation.

This seems unreasonable. A smaller population should be more suseptible
to the accidental loss of a set of coexisting types, as observed in the
simulations. I am unclear as to the explanation.
