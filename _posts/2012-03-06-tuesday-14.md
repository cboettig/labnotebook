* Confirm travel plans for tomorrow



### pdg-control

* [Stability analysis](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/master/inst/examples/stability.md)
* speeding up policycosts (extra loop) will probably require some C coding.  Meanwhile could hard-code in the profit function to accelerate things.  
* model averaging (mimic the fisheries science work & climate models that present distribution of outcomes over different models as the range of possibilities, lacking probabilities assigned to those models...). 
* work on model estimation
* externalization: Note that we can tangle a file to create a .R script that can be used for externalization, rather than having to copy-paste the chunks.  Nice if we want to source in rather than knit a file too.  

### Treebase

* Treebase manuscript writing...
* having to knit from R terminal, trouble with makefiles and knit script?  

need to use `require(methods)` and `require(utils)` separately?  


### Computing

* Updated the pmc vignette successfully.  
* Kcachegrind comments to Hadley.  
* Are static pages the future?
* [Install/switch to Octopress?](http://www.yodi.me/blog/2011/10/24/github-custom-domain-with-octopress-in-ubuntu-oneiric-11-dot-10/) Pretty far from WP one-click installation...  Software with large number of dependencies that are not packaged through the apt-get manager.  Package conflicts that require manually reverting to older packages. Guide breaks over different Ubuntu versions. What aspect of this is simple and stable?  
* Ah, [Jekyll bootstrap](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3521426). Brilliant.
