## ASN talk


Working on ASN talk (primarily introduction), again.  

- grand challenges of global change, consequences for ecosystems and the services they provide, economies, and biodiversity.

- To manage these things, we need some understanding of how they behave, and how they respond to our management options.  We need a model

- When data is unavailable, a mechanistic model is the best thing.  When mechanisms are unavailable, the data is the best thing...

- Classical modeling approaches alone won't work.  (But they should still help guide what we do!)

- This amount of complexity, this amount of data, would require too many parameters.  we never estimate all of them. uncertainty is too large. 

- Stop trying to shove all the data into a handful of parameters.  or an army of parameters.  

- management needs non-parametric approaches for decision making.

How to explain cyberinfrastructure?  


Cyberinfrastructure is a hard sell, because like any infrastructure: when it works we take it for granted unless it breaks.  Before it exists we don't realize we need it; or recognize that it is the implementation and not the idea that requires brilliance.   

The other problem is nerd jargon. The problem with nerd jargon is that as a nerd, you get so incredibly excited by these words that you can't help yourself.  To us each one is this shiny new box of awesomeness.  To appreciate this, visit an Apple store on the launch of their latest product.  In a grey or black rectangle, it's just a lump of melted sand. To the buyers, it is the pinnacle of thought, design and engineering. -->
