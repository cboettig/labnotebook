## Duncan Meeting

* ROAuth/RCurl question.  Mendeley is OAuth 1, github is OAuth 2 (simpler).  Both are implemented in pure R in another package, may be good.  OAuth 1 constructs complicated http urls with secret, and token, and random key, need to escape chars, etc.  OAuth 2 is https, just uses token.
* Authentication options: Jeff's ROAuth/Duncan's mod, other OAuth package.
* RMendeley-- windows binary, competition?
* socialR -- discussed strategy to get a figure with matching code and data.  Tracing, codeDepends, defining syntax.
* TreeBASE -- iEvoBio lightning talk, data integration competition?  integrate 3 sources: TreeBASE, Dryad, Mendeley?  Github share scripts?
* Dryad: Scott on board.


## Alan Meeting

* Finding requisite sampling density.
* Switching to ROC curves?  Yup.  Include graphic illustrating how they are computed.

* Rephrasing critique of what's done: quantifying it's performance vs understanding it's performance (move latter to appendix).
* Data/lit.

## Coding and writing

- Working on updating manuscript figures
- MCMCMC routine on wrightscape example still manages to throw errors sometimes, not clear why.  more debugging.


## Misc

Always takes me a moment to remember how to grab a deleted or changed file from an earlier commit to the repository, thought I better write it down.  Now tracking these useful bits under code-tricks (maybe should keep them as gists too?  If only gists could have tag structure, etc)


```bash
git checkout 81e8a9fac4a862ca097ae2ef693fbfe33a0970c5 roc_curve_ex.R
```


Reuse of phylogenetic info: Looking at [MIAPA](https://www.nescent.org/sites/evoio/MIAPA) project (Leebens-Mack _et. al._ 2006), [NSF ABI](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5444).  Wonder if the TreeBASE project (maybe with Dryad+Mendeley interfaces) can be turned into a[ iEvoBio challenge entry](http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) (deadline June 13!)
