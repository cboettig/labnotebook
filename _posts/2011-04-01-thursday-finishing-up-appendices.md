### What's still running:

	
* likelihood for IBM data with 2000 replicates, nice 19 on zero ([ibm_likelihood.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/master/warningsignals/demos/ibm_likelihood.R))
* likelihood for Glaciation I-III with 2000 replicates, nice 18 on zero (deut_likelihood.R)
* likelihood for Glaciation I-III with 2000 replicates, (nice 19 on one)? ([deut_likelihood.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/master/warningsignals/demos/deut_likelihood.R))
* likelihood on sim data, Glaciation III and CaCO3: 80 replicates on one, nice 1 on one (figure3.R)
* and with 2000 replicates, nice 19 on one ([figure3.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/master/warningsignals/demos/figure3.R))
* likelihood between LTC and LSN for CaCO3 and Glaciation III with 2000 replicates  ([model_choice.R](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/master/warningsignals/demos/model_choice.R))
* Drake data all replicate deteriorating stability examples, figs 1-3 (on zero nice 16?)
