For the past four years I have made an effort to sign all my reviews
(which I try to keep to about one a month).  It isn't because I believe
in radical openness or something crazy like that.  Its really just
my self interest involved -- at least mostly.  Writing a review is
an incredibly time consuming, and largely thankless task.  Supposedly
anonymous peer review is supposed to protect the reviewer, particularly
the scenario of the less established scientist critiquing the work of
the more established.  I am sure it occasionally serves that purpose.
On the other hand, that very scenario can be the *most* profitable time
to sign a review.  Really, when are you more likely to get an esteemed
colleague to closely read your every argument than when you're holding
up their publication?

While the possibility of a vindictive and powerful author sounds daunting,
but rather inconsistent with my impression of most scientists, who are
more apt to be impressed by an intelligent even if flawed critique than
by simple praise.  I find it hardest to sign a review that I have found
very little constructive criticism to offer, though after a decade
of being trained to critique science one can always find something.
(Of course signing can be hard on the occasional terrible paper for
which it is hard to offer much constructive criticism, but fortunately
that has been very rare). Both authors and other reviewers (who are
sometimes sent the other reviews, a practice I find very educational
as a reviewer) have on occasion commented or complemented me on reviews
or acknowledged me in the papers, suggesting that the practice does
indeed provide for some simple recognition. At times, it may sow seeds
for future collaboration.


Signing my reviews has on occasion given the author a chance to follow
up with me directly. While I'm not certain about journal policies in
this regard, I suspect we can assume that we're all adults capable
of civil discussion.  In any event, a phone call or even a few back-and-forth
emails can be immensely more efficient in allowing an author to clarify
elements that I have sometimes misunderstood or been unable to follow from
the text, as well as making it easier to communicate my difficulties with
the paper.  In my experience this has resulted in both a faster and
more satisfactory resolution to issues that have led to see some papers published
more quickly and without as many tedious multiple rounds of revision. Given
that many competitive journals simply cut off papers that might otherwise
be successful with a bit more dialog between reviewer and author, because
multiple "Revise and resubmits" put too much demand on editors, this seems
like a desirable outcome for all involved.  I'm not suggesting that such
direct dialog is always desirable, but that no doubt many of us have been
in the position in which a little dialog might have resolved issues more
satisfactorily.
