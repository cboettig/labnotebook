Working on ESA presentation.  See slides and code for details.



	
  * Adding movie a time series which gets longer (and closer to collapse) each frame, with corresponding warning signals for the interval thus far shown below (for CV and autocorrelation).  Include sparsely sampled (100) and densely sampled (1000) examples.  Compare always using a sliding window-size equal to half the length of the available data (works well on longer time series) to a fixed-width sliding window (doesn't work well ever).

	
  * Added two examples to introduce tau as measure of quantifying an increase.
