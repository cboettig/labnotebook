### Model roundup

1.  **metapop** Two populations with one-step transitions. IBM in C
    code, R interface to IBM and linear noise approximation.
2.  **crowley** One-step transitions version of metapop. R interface to
    IBM and linear noise.
3.  **beetles** Two-step transitions with exponential waiting times in
    age classes. R interface completed in ind\_based\_models.R
4.  **hastings** Simple two-step model. no R interfaces yet.
5.  **tribolium** Non-markov aging process. R interface completed in
    simulate.R. includes likelihood inference as well.

-   Individual-based models, implemented in C using my gillespie
    library, interfaced in R in ind\_based\_models.R. Could probably
    benefit from C++ class structure, as the codes involve more written
    repetition than necessary, and renaming similar functions to avoid
    name conflicts in the object files for the R package. All individual
    simulations now include parallelization of replicates the C level
    via the gillespie library, which seems to be working correctly even
    when called from R.

-   R files with model names include individual based simulation and the
    approximation, plotted in comparison.

-   Beetles simple noise simulation likewise does not agree with the
    approximation, still troubleshooting the approximation.

Other exploration
-----------------

Revisit Phil Holmes notes on free-response protocol / information theory
and Neyman-Pearson theorem.

Meetings
--------

-   Schreiber Lab meeting, discussed articles 4 and 5 below.
-   Discussion with Graham, see phylogenetics notebook.
-   GTC meeting, more on toolbox, interesting stats discussion
    afterwards, neg binomial as number of failures before n successes,
    claim that this almost always outperforms poisson models (in
    information criteria sense) on ecological datasets -- nothing is
    ever uncorrelated...

Misc Code
---------

Apparently R doesn't have a convenient generalized eigenvalue solver
(for case of a matrix on either side). Wrote quick interface to the gsl
lapack routines. Github's gists seem an ideal way to store and share
such code snippets, so here it is embedded.
