## multiple-uncertainty

Working out the multiple uncertainty computational performance and noise forms.  Fixing a few things in the way log-normal noise was calculated.  Uniform noise in particular can still give rather non-smooth policy, needs a bit of digging.  Uniform noise doesn't show the non-monotonicity of the log-normal noise in measurement uncertainty though.

### log

- A few small tweaks to probability calculations
  1. Handle the case of mu = grid zero, not just exactly zero, to avoid introducing NAs
  2. Calculate dlnorm as `(x_grid/mu, 0, sigma)`, rather than as `(x_grid, mu, sigma)`.
  3. Transpose of measurement error in `M %*% F`.  Because now we want to treat x as given, integrate over range of y?  (no, probably not?)
  4. standardize noise level between old and g [12:52 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/0f7889f9ce483735228e708b1f0770f295343d1d)

- With transposed M time F. (include image)  [01:04 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/e277e624334e7f6d2e3367676b032cac3eea26c2)

- And now without transpose, M %*% F [01:07 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/11f7d709775769c6f1cb1dca38b73d0b3b395742)

- Larger (log-normal in all variables) noise, weirder results. [01:39 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/ae6f7ff220a566c76330b8204529f3a5ec8aea8c)

- Changes improving performance of F calculation (rate-limiting step)
  1. vectorized calculation of mu.
  2. matrix-based calc of deterministic part of growth rate [02:13 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/d5f2509c5341dc3be2706dd42caaa7642ec6e782)

- Another efficiency change. Not identical but appears to be a decent approximation: Snap mu to the x_grid, and look up the pdfn value rather than calculating it each time in F. [03:00 pm 2012/11/22](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/commit/f151258fe146199dd34cc0194fea55515e3f8716)


Now pretty efficient. Matrix multiplication is dominant time sink, followed by the applys.  `snap_to_grid` is probably the slowest functional contribution.
