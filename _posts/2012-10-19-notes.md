Semantic Notebook notes
-----------------------

**Reading**

-   Nice [collection of posts on scholarly
    html](http://scholarlyhtml.org/faq/), but too little mention of the
    serious linked data stuff coming out of biscol, ievobio/nescent,
    etc. In particular, Martin's [history]
    (http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/)
    gives some nice perspective.\
-   The war for schema. Which ontologies should we choose? (e.g.
    [schema.org's
    take](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/07/schema-org-for-scholarly-html/)

**Puzzles**

-   How do we [mix
    ontologies](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12983766)
-   How do we meet [Google Rich Snippets requirements using
    FOAF?](http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/19200/satisfy-google-rich-snippets-person-standard-using-foaf)
-   How do we [avoid redundant vocabulary
    terms?](http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/19275/what-to-do-about-redundant-rdfa-or-machines-that-speak-only-one-language)

Basically we can do this using implicit reasoning (exploiting the logic
of linked data), but we may prefer to be explict. [This
video](http://vimeo.com/28667500) does a nice job of explaining these
concepts. Basically, if we do this right, we should be able to
“dereference” an object away from a particular ontology.

-   On [the good & the bad of schema.org and the role of search
    giants](http://manu.sporny.org/2011/false-choice/)

### Resources

-   [rdfa extractor](http://getschema.org/rdfaliteextractor/about) (into
    RDF, JSON, n3). Also has validator, but doesn't point to the `nu`
    variant for html5.
-   [RDFa Play](http://rdfa.info/play/). Wow, very nice.\
-   [sameAs.org](http://sameas.org) - search onotologies for an existing
    term, identify identical terms in different ontologies, etc. Simply
    brilliant, what I've always wanted!
-   Still not clear on rdfa vs html5. Why in the world should `dc:title`
    be preferable to `<title>` ?

### knitcitations update: adding formats an semantics.

-   Looking at citeproc / [CSL](http://citationstyles.org/) [github
    page](https://github.com/citation-style-language).\
-   Raw citeproc is an XML stylesheet, XSLT, which can render XML into
    HTML (and much more). Possible other options are using something
    like citeproc-js or citeproc-ruby, or writing citeproc-R.\
-   Not quite clear how to take a CSL and a set of references and
    generate HTML; aforementioned packages may address this.\
-   For the moment, probably easier to convert R `bibitem` to display
    with RDFa with scholarlyhtml recommended ontology than to enter raw
    XML reference and format via citeproc. Should also support adding in
    the cito tags. With full addresses in property, should be able to
    avoid any need for namespace/header modifications.
