Assembling material/outline for my SICB presentation in January, will be giving a practice talk in the Wainwright lab on Wednesday.  15 minute presentation with 5 minutes for questions.



	
  * Designing presentation in "storyboard" format in Inkscape.  Will figure out if I convert to slides or not.

	
  * Simulations under the Anoles dataset to show posterior distributions of lambda.  Exploring the connection between the likelihood of a parameter under each model to that of the distributions of the likelihood ratio.  Clearly more valuable to look at likelihood of the whole data than that of a (not necessarily good) summary statistic (model parameter that isn't a sufficient statistic).

	
  * To that effect, I've added the ability to estimate likelihood of a parameter under the alternative model, rather than just bootstrapping parameters directly.

	
  * Have also begun developing socialR package to handle the social reporting functions more smoothly.


See github and flickr logs for today for more details.
