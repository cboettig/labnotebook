[Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf)

Far from implemented, though the tools and resources at the newly created [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io) (hosted on Github!) look very promising.  Some choice quotations below: 

-----------------

Pursuant to Executive Order of May 9, 2013, _"Making Open and Machine Readable the New  Default for Government Information"_


_Any datasets in the agency's enterprise data inventory that can be made publicly available must be listed at `www.<agency>.gov/data` in a 
human- and machine-readable format that enables automatic aggregation by Data.gov and other services (known as "harvestable files"), to the extent practicable._


__Open data__: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term "open data" refers to publicly available data 
structured in a way that enables the data to be fully discoverable and usable by end users. In general, 
open data will be consistent with the following principles: 

* _Public_. Agencies must adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted by law and subject to [...] valid restrictions. 
* _Accessible_. Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open fonnats that can be 
retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are 
reasonably structured to allow automated processing). [...] made available to the widest range of users for 
the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the 
extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no 
restrictions should be placed upon their use. 
* _Described_. Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to 
understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how 
to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that 
describe data). 
* _Reusable_. Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use. 
* _Complete_. Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest 
possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived 
or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data. 
* _Timely_. Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. 
Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs. 
* _Managed Post-Release_. A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond 
to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.
