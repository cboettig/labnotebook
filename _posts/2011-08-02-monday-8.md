## Peter advice


* Figure out your focus.
* Have all the stuff from your PhD published (at least submitted), make sure your post-doc moves forward.  (#1 mistake).
* Publish with data folks to show you have much to offer the non-theorist community
* Speak to potential advisers, get them excited about the work.
* Berkeley over Michigan over NESCent/NIMBioS.
* Visit Berkeley.  Ackerley on sabbatical?

## Review for Theoretical Ecology

Working on another review. Not a bad paper, but presenting many classical results as novel.  Dear would-be authors in theoretical ecology: Please read Nisbet & Gurney 1982, Chesson & Ellner 1984, Benheim & Schreiber 2010 before submitting an article about stochastic population dynamics.

## Paper

* Add citation -- done
* Update Figure 1
* disclaimer paragraph? -- done
* parenthetical references to supp and methods
* how to choose a result?


## Presentation

* Cartoonify stable and tipping
* Model fit comparison?
