### writing writing writing:



Mostly writing this week, so my notebook has been lacking in entries. Trying to move several manuscripts forward: two are papers accompanying software packages for extracting, manipulating and visualizing data from online repositories (TreeBase and FishBase); part of the rOpenSci project. These databases are great, but it difficult to pursue really interesting questions until we can spin it around on our fingertips.  Web-based repositories make the data easily accessible but not easily manipulable.  The R language provides a powerful and widely used platform to explore, visualize, and manipulate data once we have it.  These packages aim to bridge the gap between access and use, between the web, and R.
