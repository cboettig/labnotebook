Partially Observable Stochastic Processes (cont.)
=========================================

- Reading a bit more about `pomp`.  Looks like SCM and PMCMC offer nicely Bayesian inference tools using the same framework (`rprocess` and `dmeasure`), making a nice platform for implementing multiple methods. Almost feels like having the likelihood equation in hand again. 
- A bit more skeptical about nonlinear forecasting and  probe matching, as they feel even more heuristic or arbitrary.  I suppose that's just the price of having only `rmeasure` instead of `dmeasure` available though.  Perhaps worth a closer look. 
- Time to implement some saddle-node models and see what we can get...
- Also need to spend a bit more time working through examples on Vasilis's `earlywarings` package.
- About ready to submit Prosecutor's Fallacy paper.  Repeating runs, some touch up on presentation still needed.

Evolution stuff
===============

- treebase manuscript re-organization. -- done
- treebase mansuscript simplify / clarify language -- done
- treebase select examples, move technical examples to appendix -- done
- treebase finalize new function list. -- done
- More writing on Wrightscape manuscript.  Reply to Peter.
- rfishbase new version to CRAN? 

Treebase miscellaneous exploration examples?

- (histogram of species in treebase?)
- gene tree diversification rates vs species tree?
- gene tree of taxon of interest

Logistics
=========

- ESA 2012 flight booked. Registration paid.  need housing...
- Sent query for CSGF 2012 flights
- Need to book Evolution flight.  Registration paid, housing paid. 
- file reimbursements
