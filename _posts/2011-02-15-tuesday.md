In at 8:30.  10a and still getting through Google Reader journals, emails.

	
  * Finished up yesterday's entry and posted.
  * Exploring some of the new developments in Wordpress for scientists.    Some trouble with the link2link code interfacing with kcite.  No luck  yet on mathjax: renders the shortcode instead of the equations, i.e $dx = \sigma d B_t$
  * NIMBioS workshop inquiry: Offering a workshop on HPC in R, I  was curious about the scope and depth of the workshop.  Sounds like it  aims at getting researchers to move R code from desktop level to running  on[ RDAV Kraken](http://rdav.nics.tennessee.edu/) through NSF's teragrid.  Still not quite clear on what functions or tools this involves teaching (R packages?  basic server access/bash/ssh etc?)
  * Working out final plans for [Data Management Workshop](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/905).
  * Merritt databases inquiries, see my [notes here](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1019).
  * And back to writing on the warning signals paper...
