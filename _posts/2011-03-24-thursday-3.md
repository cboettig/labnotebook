  * Assembled plots for figures 1,2,3 see paper_plots.R.  Considerable adjustment of axes/layout.  Sent figures out for comments.

	
  * Considered removing skew/kurtosis from Figure 1 &/or Figure 2, currently leaving in (particularly in Figure 2 to make point clear that no indicator works well?)  Easy to remove using paper_plots.R script.




### To Do list:





	
  * Figure 3 layout should mimic Figure 2 as much as possible (font sizes, margins, etc).

	
  * Consider an arrow along the x-axis rather than dotted line for observed value.

	
  * Distribution color legend

	
  * Rewrite captions

	
  * Figure 2 y-axis labels shouldn't appear as "Variance" "Skew" but be clear these are probability densities

	
  * Figures to explain Type I and Type II error, like these:
