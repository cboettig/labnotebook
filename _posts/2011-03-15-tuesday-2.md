## Variance and warning signals


Sebastian has several examples of dynamical systems that decrease in variance as they approach a bifurcation.  In some sense this is not surprising, both are through the collapse of periodic attractors.  Figure 2d in TPB paperSchreiber, 2003 has an example in a discrete system, and Figure 5a in the Ecology Letters paper (Schreiber & Rudolf, 2008) has a continuous-time example.  Consider for instance the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, in which a stable limit cycle vanishes into an unstable node, as in a van der Pol oscillator,

$$\frac{d x}{dt} = -\mu(1-y^2) x-y $$

$$\frac{dy}{dt}= x $$

  * Some quick background reading on GTR+I+G, [see post here](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/1197).




## Further simulation examples


Yesterday's runs often show inadequate power to distinguish even by likelihood.  Trying slightly stronger signal of collapse (faster destabilization rate).


### Code library updates


Improved tag and comment handling for strings, in flickr upload through socialR, thanks to Gabriel on statscicomp for this one

    
    ## basic syntax is:
    paste(c("a", "b", "c"), collapse=" ")  
    ## lets me grab all model parameters into comment
    comment <- paste(c(names(pars), ":", pars, "\\", names(sampling), ":", sampling, "nboot:", nboot), collapse=" ")


since flickr_upload protocol wants a single element string for comments and tags.  Should use these to check against hashtags to ensure parameters are handled correctly.  May want to incorporate into the interface somehow.


## Misc





	
  * Created profile on [National Lab Network](http://nationallabnetwork.org) for education/outreach after reading a rather interesting paper in PLoS (Rumala _et. al._ 2011) discussing the program.

	
  * Data management videos from Marcel, still need posting and writeup.

	
  * Interview with first Dean candidate 4:15-5:30.
