## Prosecutors Fallacy 

Running the null distribution and add to plots

- generate [nulls](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/blob/35ea8b6d9aee76ed2814c32bb4d5b4ec861af0eb/inst/examples/nullfallacy.md)
- add to [fallacy](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/blob/90696473b0d98a506e337cbd80a85cec5be51736/inst/examples/fallacy.md)
- Questions on plots -- show the full replicates plot?
- Emphasize the two different distributions that result.
- [Additional replicates](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/blob/35ea8b6d9aee76ed2814c32bb4d5b4ec861af0eb/inst/examples/nullfallacy.md) narrow the null distribution further. hmm...
- run model fit part again [modelfallacy.Rmd](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning/blob/prosecutor/inst/examples/modelfallacy.md). Need to add the model fit data analysis section into this script.  
- knitr's caching really is the way to go with debugging things that need HPC.  Nice to pick up from where we hit the bug rather than rerunning everything. Must remember to set unique cache paths though.
