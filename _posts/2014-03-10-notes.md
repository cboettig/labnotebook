- Reading [Caldwell et al, Geophysical Letters](http://doi.org/10.1002/2014GL059205 "Statistical Significance of Climate Sensitivity Predictors Obtained by Data Mining"). Good example of naiive data mining leading to spurious correlations from non-independent models.  (/ht @[FreshwaterEcology](http://twitter.com/FreshwaterEcology)

- Remote control for Ubuntu via android?  Considering: 
  - xbmc with xbmc-remote: Looks promising if a bit heavy; connection unsuccessful.  
  - WiFi Mouse successful connection via autoconnect and thethered wireless, works pretty smothly with limited setup.  Does need root running `mouseserver`, installed from an open source `.deb` file.

Bayesian Early Warning
----------------------

Continuing calculation from [2013/12/10](http://carlboettiger.info/2013/12/10/notes.html), which integrates out $\theta$.  Next steps: 

- Integrate out $\sigma$
- Grid-search $\alpha$
- Implement numerically
- Implement approach for time-heterogeneous case.  


Simplifying and combing terms from where we left off: the integral of some Gaussian of variance $\nu$ evaluates to $\sqrt{2\pi \nu}$ which we solved for previously, giving us:  

$$f(A_t) \left( 2 \pi V_t \right)^{-(T-1)/2} \left( 2 \pi V_t \right)^{1/2}  \left(B^2(T-1) \right)^{-1/2}$$

$$ = f(A_t) \left( 2 \pi V_t \right)^{-(T-2)/2}   \left(B^2(T-1) \right)^{-1/2}$$

Substituting in for $V$ to have explicitly in terms of sigma, (**note**: Correcting the $f(A_t)$ term, which was missing the denominator in the earlier version of  [2013/12/10](http://carlboettiger.info/2013/12/10/notes.html), now fixed).  

$$ = \exp\left(\frac{}{}\right)  \sigma^{-(T-2)} \left( \frac{\pi}{\alpha}\left(1- e^{-\alpha t}\right) \right)^{-(T-2)/2}   \left(B^2(T-1) \right)^{-1/2}$$

and is then is integrable in terms of $\sigma$ by recognizing this as a Gamma integral, 

$$ =  f(A_t)  \sigma^{-(T-2)} \left( \frac{\pi}{\alpha}\left(1- e^{-\alpha t}\right) \right)^{-(T-2)/2}   \left(B^2(T-1) \right)^{-1/2}$$
