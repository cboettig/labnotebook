-   Sent drafts of Likelihood ratio paper to Peter Wainwright (Sunday
    08/08) and Graham Coop (Monday 08/09)

Wrightscape
-----------

-   Sent Peter more information on the release of constraint results in
    the Labrid system.
-   Starting wrightscape manuscript.

#### Changes to [wrightscape.R](http://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/4556a517a96467d5efe993ec585adcc66b925c46/R/wrightscape.R "http://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/4556a517a96467d5efe993ec585adcc66b925c46/R/wrightscape.R")

-   added a tree plotting function to the wrighttree class.
-   labels on parameter bootstrap distributions for labrids in last
    week's entry reversed wrasses and parrotfish. I've updated the
    software so that the plotting function takes care of the labeling
    automatically (when these were made it had to be added manually,
    while the automation of the data conversions and the painting by
    clade reversed the label assignments).
