#### Resilience seminar

	
* the unhelpful resilience of invaded systems (ecosystem engineers anyone?  Cheatgrass change the fire regime, salt-cedar )  Examples in cheatgrass invading sagebrush, and saltcedar invading cottonwoods.
* Variables on axes?  Problem of dimensionality? resilient to what?
* Carpenter's rigidity trap (need to eliminate something) vs poverty trap (something is missing)
* promote a small disturbance to reset the system  -- when are small disturbances stabilizing?  (escape the rachet?)


#### pdg-control
	
* Summary for Training Problem II

#### Warning Signals

* Figures for Alan paper.  (what to do with distributions)
* Updating code to provide full replicate simulations, and properly handle parameter distributions.
* rewriting warningsignals package for better S3 abstraction
* ROC curves as separate section to compare between results.
