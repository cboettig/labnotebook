Seems that the level of caution observed in the deterministic scenario relative to the increasing noise scenarios comes, perhaps not surprisingly, from the addition of harvesting costs, rather than from overcompensatory dynamics or the asymmetric forms of the noise, which seem to have quantitative but not qualitative differences.
