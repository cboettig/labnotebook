## Reflections


Conferences are really about people.  Nice to the see familiar faces: Heather Piowowar, Jason Priem, Karthik Ram, Carly Strasser, William Gunn.  Nice to finally meet Dario Taraborelli (ReaderMeter).  Good to see Trisha Cruse, John Kunze, and Stephen Abrams for CDL, and meet some of the others from CDL.   Good to meet Sylvia Spengler NSF's program director for information integration and Informatics.  Ben Rubin from Elseviers developer portal, and talk to Eric Kansa on use of Merritt in social sciences in Berkeley, (and the Edinborough georeferencing text software).  And of course the tweeps who I didn't get to catch in person but enjoyed the online interactions none the less: Todd Carpenter, Sarah Callaghan.

Highlight discussions from some of the breaks:  (1) Where's the snoody journal of data, where it's really hard to get data accepted due to broad impact and high standards required?  (2) Do we need a research on effective research?  How do we generate such a community?

Also see:  [Decoupling the Scholarly Journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDOy9GXXrUFc9TUIR2C470DTau8JEgZ9k-SMNIx5pb8/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CMeCqOYD), from Jason Priem.

Should also look into granular identifiers for my notebook objects, so I can capture version history in the image log as well as code log.



###  Reflections & notes from others 



[Reflections from Karthik ](http://inundata.org/2011/08/25/datacite-2011-recap/)on DataCite 2011.  

Twitter log to much to archive here, but William Gunn has put together a nice collection of the links/references shared during over the feed on [storify](http://storify.com/mrgunn/links-to-datacite-presentations-and-sites-mentione?awesm=sfy.co_FgI&utm_campaign=mrgunn&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&utm_source=direct-sfy.co&utm_content=storify-pingback).

DataCite will probably make an official compilation of slides, etc, so more references soon.  Also feel free to note others in the comments.
