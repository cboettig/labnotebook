### Outline

**Title**

*On the ability to detect leading indicators of catastrophe in
unreplicated time series*

**Introduction** Background on Warning Signals

1.  [literature](http://www.mendeley.com/research-papers/collections/1374711/EarlyWarningSigns/ "http://www.mendeley.com/research-papers/collections/1374711/EarlyWarningSigns/")
2.  Saddle Node bifurcation
3.  Detecting decreasing stabilization -- gradual vs changepoint
    estimation

Reasons detection can fail:

1.  Ergodicity: ensembles vs single instances
2.  Sufficient statistical power
3.  Appropriate dynamics

**Methods**

-   Defining an indicator -- significant Kendall rank correlation
    coefficient Ï„ as in
    [doi:10.1073/pnas.0802430105](http://hdl.handle.net/10.1073/pnas.0802430105 "doi:10.1073/pnas.0802430105")
-   Simulation approach
-   Analytic limits
-   accounting for delay?

**Figures**

-   Saddle node bifurcation example -- should discuss difference between
    stochastic and deterministic edge?
-   Single replicates using standard detection statistics

**Results/Discussion**

-   Misleading indicators
-   Need for further exploration
