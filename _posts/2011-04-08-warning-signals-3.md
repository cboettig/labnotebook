* ibm simulation fit convergence on constOU vs constLSN -- are likelihood scores off from including out-of-bound parameter estimates?
* Consider transcritical in levins model setup
* Consider re-arranging figures: one panel, full-width, variance and autocorrelation only, three empirical examples.
* Trying smaller numbers of replicates in simulated data to get low-power examples.

* move ibm simulation code into warningsignals package
* Working through Marissa's edits.
