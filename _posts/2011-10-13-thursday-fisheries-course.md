Fisheries impact on forage fish.  Forage fish impact on the primary fisheries.

Benguela Current upwelling (Anchovy collapse)

Discussion of: Prey switching impact?

Wasp-waist ecosystems

Ecopath/ecosim vs [Atlantis](http://www.csiro.au/science/Atlantis-ecosystem-model.html)

Questions:

Can we identify the nature of control?

Importance of wasp-waist control.

regime switching

Negative impact of forage fish on ground fish. e.g. Iceland appearance of mackerel in their waters.  Can they fish it as an invasive

Groundfish, like cod, can eat primarily forage fish, or invertebrates

Big gaps:

* modeling tools, non-equilibrium.
* examples where forage fish collapse
* variability, impact of variability.
* Where the heck are the innate oscillations.
