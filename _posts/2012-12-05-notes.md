### Workflow Workshop

At Simone's invitation, I'm running a little session on workflow in git/Github, Rstudio, and knitr for the Mangel lab group.  A quick brainstorm for an outline:

#### A first tutorial

1. Create a new repository on Github
2. launch an RStudio session, select create new project
3. Add the `git@` url to the project, select a local directory, hit "create"
4. In Rstudio, create new R Markdown file.  
5. Editing the file.  Hit "Knit HTML" button.  
6. add the files to git: git tab, check boxes.
7. commit the .Rmd and md files, and push files to Github.  
8. Viewing files on github.  

9. Navigating Github: Project directory, viewing `.md` files, raw mode, viewing history of a file, getting permanent links to specific versions.  
10: Github extras: using issues. (Referencing issues in commits)

1. Recovering a deleted file.  


#### Git More Advanced

* Create a gh-pages branch and add the html generated from the Rstudio/knitr.  (Covers branching & webpage hosting on github)
* Create a github homepage
* Merging changes, resolving conflicts.
* collaborating via github.  
* why sha hashes are awesome
* private repositories
* Repo Readmes


#### Other topics

* Managing references. Sharing collections (Mendeley)
* References in markdown. Pandoc.  (knitcitations?)
* Managing data. Figshare.  
* Social media for science.
