## Scientific Research: Moving beyond bubbles to platforms.


[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21593580-cheap-and-ubiquitous-building-blocks-digital-products-and-services-have-caused) contrasts the current start-up culture to that of the dotcom
bubble.  Their special report argues that while the dotcom bubble was
characterized by heavy investment in a single idea with a "Build it
and they will come" attitude, the current generation of startups is
characterized by tinkering and rapid experimentation.  They argue that
this is possible thanks to the cheaply available _"platforms"_ of open
source software, cloud computing, APIs, and social media dissemination.
And they argue that this time, it is no bubble. That it will eat the
world.  That these lessons apply far beyond tech startups, to businesses
in general and even governments. The special report is well worth reading
in full.

## So how about science?

After all, experimentation is what science is all about. Yet the platforms
that run that world are largely absent from scientific research.
Research looks more like the dotcom model, where each research team
must make an immense investment in infrastructure and data gathering
up front.  Must hire expertise in-house for each step of the process,
from experimental design to data collection to analysis to writing.
Such large teams resemble more the companies of previous decades with
their own development, marketing, and research departments, then the
agile start-ups currently building the future.  The resulting products
are monolithic, "build it and they will come".

I believe that this is the cornerstone of the open science and reproducible research movement.


## Update (2014-07-24)

This seems to be exactly what Martin
Fenner is talking about in "[Roads, not
Stagecoaches](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/07/18/roads-not-stagecoaches/)"
-- the value of transformative infrastructure over individual software
contributions.
