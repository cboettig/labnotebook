Excellent CPB visiting weekend with perspective students Thurs evening - Sunday morning.  Hosting students, etc doesn't make for much of a research entry Friday.  Catching up with many things today.



	
  * [ESA registration](http://www.esa.org/austin/call_contributed.php#I). Topics, Abstract

	
  * Checking in with Alan

	
  * Data workshop: create & post advertisement, [map out subject areas](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/905)

	
  * [Reading: Syst Bio issue](http://bit.ly/hMuxi1)

  * [Bodega Phylogenetics Workshop](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/2011_Workshop) planning-- check in with Rich and Justen

	
  * [Mentioned](http://phytools.blogspot.com/2011/02/reading-trees.html) in Liam's Comparative Phylogenetics Methods blog, to address reading in simmap trees.  Liam's keeping an impressively thorough but readable development log on his blog, worth following the progress on this particular challenge of reading in the full stochastic character mapping information from Newick format trees.

### DEEP lab meeting


Nick lured most of the Hastings lab to DEEP group meeting discussing [Mumby, Hastings & Edwards 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06252), but instead presented on some of the questions he is investigating in quantifying the phylogenetic diversity of zooxanthellae  coral symbionts.  First called our attention to a somewhat strange  statistic of 'flexibility' summing weighted differences in substitutions  across a fast and slow gene.  Discussed more natural methods predicated  on an ultrametric tree -- Peter proposed a common metric of distance  which Erik Matsen has a fast algorithm for calculating. Gives distances   between tree distributions but not a baseline (is basically amount of  work required to transform one distribution into the other through  movements along the tree.  Discussed whether there was a meaningful null  baseline (such as equal splits of probability coming up from the root.   Sebastian also proposed cumulative branch length as a possible metric,  discussion was still in high swing when I had to leave for 5pm meeting.
