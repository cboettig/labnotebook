## Prosecutor

* Add figures for both examples with and without ASS
* text to accomidate both examples
* ROC curves?
* proof-reading

## ews-review

* looking over revisions, touch-ups
* See issues log for details

## Links

* Impressive set of tools provided by the Whitehouse [open data project](http://project-open-data.github.io/)  In particular, see the [tool](https://github.com/project-open-data/csv-to-api) for generating a RESTful API from CSV files and the "common core" [metadata definitions](http://project-open-data.github.io/metadata-resources/#common_core_required_fields_equivalents).  Notebook complies with many of these (throught the Dublin core RDFa), but looks like I could benefit from adding some more terms from the [Data Catalog Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#property--access-download). Awesome that this site is built with Twitter-Bootstrap and Jekyll, hosted on Github, and licenced as CC-BY (content) and MIT (code). See for example, the [issues log](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/issues).  


## Notebook

* added black-white theme for readers that prefer higher contrast / more traditional appearance.  Otherwise matches the orginal feel reasonably well.  ([#70](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/70))

* Dropped the local javascript based search using the stemming engine ([#7](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/7)).  The stemming search was reasonably fast, but only matches words instead of phrases (and adds considerable overhead to generating the site).
