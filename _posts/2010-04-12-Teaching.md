Notes potentially for my EDG talk.

"Keeping Up" -- a talk to EDG?
------------------------------

Science is growing. Fast. Number of papers published. Genomes on
Genbank. Software on CRAN. Everyone's felt the pressure. So what do we
do? Keeping with tradition, I'll present my own work in developing
comparative phylogenetic methods to identify niche differentiation in
Labrid fish. I will try and use this context to pose the question --
what do we do about this information explosion?? I'll review some data
to frame the rate of this change and highlight three particular
challenges: (1) Big Science - Big Collaborations, (2) Evaluating
Science: Quality, Reproducibility, Impact, (3) Rising Demand for Broader
Impacts. I'll review literature evaluating what is and isn't effective,
present a few examples and tools with which some hope to face these
challenges and opportunities.

I'm not really qualified to give an opinion on all this, but I'm
interested to give it a try. Bring questions and opinions or maybe we'll
hear a lot more about multitype OU processes.

    and free time... whoops.

### Big Science

#### **Collaborating across barriers**

Which is harder: research [across institutes or across
disciplines](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306312705055535 "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306312705055535")?

-   **Geographic distance**:
    -   Who has worked with someone at another institution? Multiple
        institutions?
    -   [National Evolutionary Synthesis
        Center](http://www.nescent.org/index.php "http://www.nescent.org/index.php").
        who has attended working groups, catalysis meetings?

-   **Collaborating across disciplines**
    -   Rise of interdisciplinary centers, initiatives, and
        [education](http://hdl.handle.net/10.1126/science.1095480 "doi:10.1126/science.1095480")

-   **Effectiveness and Challenges**
    -   [Science of
        Science](https://www.nescent.org/science/sos.php "https://www.nescent.org/science/sos.php"),
        [New NSF

    -   What makes these effective / ineffective? [Research on

#### **Really really big collaborations, informal groups?**

-   Coordinate simultaneous development of a project with hundreds of
    collaborators? Regularly happens in software development

[Computer Scientists work in huge
groups](http://lumberjaph.net/blog/index.php/2010/03/25/github-explorer/ "http://lumberjaph.net/blog/index.php/2010/03/25/github-explorer/"),

-   [not often taught
    how](http://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Foreword-Why_Traditional_Student_Projects_Are_Ineffective.html "http://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Foreword-Why_Traditional_Student_Projects_Are_Ineffective.html")
-   Informal collaborations. Mailing lists, stackoverflow, social
    networks.

### Evaluating science? Quality? Reproducibility? Impact?

#### Quality

-   Peer review/nature comments vs Amazon.com model... Cultural
    barriers. New solutions.

#### Reproducibility

-   [Reproducibility](http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol4/iss1/art2/ "http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol4/iss1/art2/")

#### Impact

-   Article level metrics. Data contribution. software contribution.
-   Rising demands for broader impacts. Science in the eye of the
    public. Communicating science.

-   -   Paper vs package. push button reproducibility. Open science

-   -   Mailing lists. [stack
        overflow.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134583/looking-for-fast-algorithm-to-find-distance-between-two-nodes-in-binary-tree "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134583/looking-for-fast-algorithm-to-find-distance-between-two-nodes-in-binary-tree")
    -   Social networks

-   -   Picnic Day, Obama's NAS speech, educational outreach, who should
        communicate science and how?
    -   Open = Impact

\

\

-   What is the minimum unit of science? A p-value? An equation?
    Definition? Hypothesis? A page or edit on a wiki? A paper.
    -   What moves science forward in comparative phylogenetics. Lots of
        kinds of contributions: data, methods, software, technical
        support.
    -   Synthetic science and linking big.

### Ways Science is changing to face these challenges

-   Generative Science, Synthetic Science, Open Science
-   New thinking -- google mindset vs yahoo. tags. [Everything is
    miscellaneous.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3wOhXsjPYM "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3wOhXsjPYM")
-   Crowd sourcing
-   Tools waste time / save time

\
 From the eyes of a young college student, this is fantastic. This is
the dawn of a golden era of science. From the eyes of an aging graduate
student looking ahead on an uncertain career trajectory, this is
terrifying.

### Survey

-   Use a social networking site
-   have joined a scientific social networking site
-   subscribe to a help mailing list
-   have asked a question to a mailing list
-   have answered a question on a list
-   collaborated with someone at another institution
-   have collaborated with someone they've never met
-   read articles as pdfs
-   keep pdfs in a database system
-   used an encyclopedia in the past 5 years
-   used wikipedia in the past 48 hours
-   used software for analysis / calculations / figures yesterday
-   how long would it take for you to reproduce that analysis now?
-   how long to reproduce the computational analysis/figures in a paper
    you've published?
-   how do you find most articles you read? ToC? recommendation?
    citation?
