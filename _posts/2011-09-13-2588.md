8:00 Coffee & Breakfast at NIMBioS
8:45 Outline for Day 2 (Donahue/Armsworth)


### Adaptive Control, Jake


Introduced by he two-armed bandit problem, Rothchild
i = 1,2.
$ T_i $ is the number of trials, $ N_i $ are numbers of successes.

Define $$ \rho_i = \frac{1}{1+T_i}, \mu_i = \frac{N_i}{1+T_i} $$

If i is played $ p_i $ becomes

$$ \frac{p_i}{1+p_i} = \frac{1}{T+2} $$

If i is played and successful $ \mu_i $ becomes

$$ s(\mu_i) = \frac{\mu_i + p_i}{p_i+1} = \frac{N_i + 1 }{T_i + 2}$$

whereas failure is

$$ s(\mu_i) = \frac{\mu_i}{p_i+1} = \frac{N_i + 1 }{T_i + 2}$$

$$ \lim_{T_i \to \infty} \frac{N_i}{T_i+1} = \tau_i $$, the true probability.

Depends on prior information and luck. Costly to pull on uncertain machine.

-------

Consider fisheries example where
$$ x = F(x) - h $$
$$ F(x) = x^{\alpha} \epsilon |_{\epsilon ~ N(0, \sigma^2} $$

$$ \ln F(x) = \alpha ln(x) + ln(\epsilon) =: y $$
$ \alpha $ must be estimated.

Frequentist:

$$ \hat \alpha = \frac{\ln x' \ln F(x)}{\ln X' \ln x} $$

Bayesian: $$ P(\alpha) N( \alpha_0, \sigma_{\alpha^2}) $$

$$ f(\alpha | y ) \sim \exp\left( \tfrac{1}{2} (y-\alpha \ln(x) )' (y- \alpha \ln(x) \right) \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{(\alpha - \alpha_0)^2}{\sigma_{\alpha}^2}\right) $$

Myopic igonre additional variation in harvest to identify $ \hat \alpha $. More variation means better estimated $ \alpha $

Michael raises two issues: applying this information elsewhere. If environment is changing, learning current condition is less valuable. (can't I learn the change rate?)

Adaptive management experiment in corals.


### 9:00 pdg-control: Approaches from Engineering & Discussion (Carl Toews)


An adaptive talk on techniques.

How do we quantify the volatility of a control law? (function space choice)
How do we measure the distance between models? Between controls?
Change an objective function to yield a better control law (regularization in inverse problems)


#### Modeling, Inverse Problems


$$ M : X \to Y $$
Forward: predicting observations from parameters. Inverse: parameters from observation.
Existence, uniqueness, stability.
$$ M = \pmatrix{ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \epsilon } $$
Not unique if $ \epsilon = 0 $

So:
Cost functional: $ J(x) := ||M(x) = y_0|| $
Regularization: $  \tilde J(x) := ||M(x) = y_0|| + \alpha ||x ||  $
Optimize: $  x_0 = \min_{x\in X} \tilde J(x)  $

Regularization means solving a suboptimal model. Fudge factor. Trade-off due to inverting an unstable operator vs error due to the objective function.

Singular value decomposition regularization example:

Linear regime [Kalman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) filter exact solution. (e.g. uncertainty in stock size, based on harvest).

True state evolves according to: $ x_{k+1} = g(x_k, v_k) $
But the observation is some function of that: $ y_{k} = h(x_k, n_k) $

Paul: Nonlinearity can be ignored by engineers, because they can intervene frequently. If you're doing management, forced to do policy control, you cannot intervene frequently enough to be linear. (e.g., $g(x_k, v_k $ is nonlinear.

Alan, Frank: quite easy for $ h(x_k, n_k) $ to be nonlinear as well, such as x being the density and y being only the moments.


#### Estimation




#### Filtering


[ Model predictive control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control):



	
  1. Read control, disturbance, output variable

	
  2. Estimate state (e.g. Kalman Filter)

	
  3. Remove ill condition (regularization)

	
  4. Local steady-sate optimization (Linear or quadratic program)

	
  5. Dynamic optimization (Dynamic programming)

	
  6. outputs control variable




## Training Problem II problem formulation


How does decreasing uncertainty improve outcomes?  Expected value of perfect information?

Model uncertainty vs parameter uncertainty.

1) Adaptive management approach to coral-algae location of phase shift. vs Passive adaptive management/MPC.

2) Nonlinearity in observation error

H inverse.  dockside landings don't include discard/bycatch.  age & space from total biomass.

3) Optimal sampling rates and intervention rate (rel to system timescale).  Compared to 3 yr rule on stock assessment.

Jim's staged approach: Overall optimal.  Conditional on fishermen sampling. compare difference.

4) Spatial signal of declines: most efficient fishing.

[Dual control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_control_theory)  = active adaptive management.

## Training problem III summary


Claire reviews dispersal problem in larva on Caribbean reefs.

Discussion of focal questions:



	
  * Unique aspects of life history problems

	
  * Metamorphosis timing, energy (optimal stopping time)
