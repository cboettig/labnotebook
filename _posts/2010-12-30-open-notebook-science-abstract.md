In addition to my primary research categories, I make some entries in my lab notebook  to document and reflect on my experiment in open notebook science.  This includes my notes on tools I try out for open and collaborative science, including uses of social media, cloud computing, and scientific databases and repositories.

This serves as a cover-page for the open science entries in my notebook, displaying the most recent entries, articles, figures and code through rss feeds.

## [Code Updates](https://github.com/cboettig/socialR)


I'm developing an R package called "socialR", which I use to interact with my notebook, github code library, flickr image database and twitter  notification system from within R.  These are the updates from the commit log, [see this entry ](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/565)for details.
