-   7:30 -- 8:30 Read ï»¿article for Wainwright's 270:

Streisfeld, M.a. & Rausher, M.D. Population Genetics, Pleiotropy, and
the Preferential Fixation of Mutations During Adaptive Evolution.
Evolution no-no(2010).doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01128.x

Interesting approach, methods description a little light and both
prediction and interpretation of pattern of mutations in coding,
cis-reg, and transcription factor sites seems a little loose. Detailed
notes on article in Mendeley. More comments after the discussion section
at 1pm today.

-   8:30 -- 9:30 accepted and started reviewing article for Theoretical
    Ecol, review due Nov 1st. Return to later! (confidential notes in
    Mendeley)
-   9:30 -- 1:00pm working on LR manuscript.
-   1pm Wainwright's 270 on predicting evolution (Streisfeld article)
-   2pm meet visiting student Ty at house
-   4:30pm set up and facilitate Grad Teaching Community meeting

Manuscript scribble

### Code updates

Added a "half different" painting of taxa to show problems with AIC
persist even when parameters don't exceed taxa (but still vastly
overparameterized). see
