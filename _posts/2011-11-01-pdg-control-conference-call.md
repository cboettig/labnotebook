Call includes everyone except Frank & Claire.


## Logistics





	
  * Meeting 2: 13-15 March

	
  * Review code/files on wiggio.

	
  * Want a group review of material / webX tutorial?  Email Paul after the call.




## Training Problem 1b: penalty to policy-change rate.


Group is: Paul, Jake, Dan, Carl T, Jim, Frank, ...



	
  * **Dan**: L2 done.  Code coming (in Python, matlab coming).  L1 is hard.

	
  * Control variable becomes $ dh/dt $, and $ h $ becomes a control variable.

	
  * an impulse-control maximum principle?

	
  * **Jim** suggests - similar to fishing-effort control?  Optimality conditions are singular?


_Material_: See Dan's summary.


## Training Problem 1a: Chattering/periodic control


Group is: Paul, Jim, Dan, Michael, ...



	
  * Collected references: some general statements in texts about when to expect periodic optimal controls

	
  * **Dan**: Just look for periodic solutions to state / co-state equations.

	
  * Advanced problem: spatial control (see proposal), talk to **Michael**.  Direct data on live fishing effort across great barrier reef.


Can we get a description of this data set?  Do we have data on policy-elasticity (re 1b)?
_Material_: still coming?


## Training Problem 2


Group is: Alan, Carl B, Jake, Michael, Carl T, Marie-Josee, ...

**Carl **Building up to the Stochastic Optimal Control Problem, then adding uncertainty / Bayesian learning.
Literature on Uncertainty (**Jake**)



	
  * Uncertainty over growth function (bang-bang).

	
  * Uncertainty over stock assessment (pretty open).


Look at **Michael**'s SDP code and Reed Reed, 1979.

_Material_: see [Carl's summary](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/3094) and Jake's lit review.


## Training Problem 3


Group is: Megan, Claire, Marie-Josee, Frank, ...

**Megan**, **Claire**.  Spawning time and investment as optimization.  Claire running simulations over space/time to generate the return-on-investment curve.  Can then determine if there's a non-trivial optimization search to be done.

_Material_: still coming.
