* Consultation call with Rebecca Lawrence, F1000.  F1000 is exploring offering a data publishing platform, and we discussed some of the potential challenges (submission incentives, data review/reproducible review, meta-data standards).

> anyone who might be interested  in working with us to get this project off the ground, with a scientific PhD background, a reasonable understanding of data sharing/mining issues and some knowledge of technical issues (not necessarily a coder but I guess it might help) then do let me know.

	
* Meeting with Graham and Peter, finalizing paper revisions.
* Meeting with John Huelsenbeck.
* Group members: Talked to Tracy. (Nick & Bastien are overseas currently)
* Meeting with Kathy Day.
