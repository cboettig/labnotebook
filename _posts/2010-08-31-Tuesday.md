Recording Reading
-----------------

Still looking for a good way to capture time snapshots of what I've
read. Perhaps the Mendeley API will have a good solution. Here I try
twapper-keeper to create an rss of my tweets on a given day, and the
google api, but not very ideal solutions. Checked a variety of ways to
[filter rss
feeds](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/6_ways_to_filter_your_rss_feeds.php "http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/6_ways_to_filter_your_rss_feeds.php")
by date so that it would just show the current ones, none seem to manage
this though.
