## phylogenetics

* Exploring display of phylogeny. Unlabled, painted fan?

* tweaking release-of-constraint plot - vary alpha, less strong?  release at T/2?  Animated version?


## Creating paintings of phylogenies

Creating from a specified set of taxa is a somewhat common task for me.  Wrightscape supports doing this for both ouch and ape trees.

* [ape-based phylogenies](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/fb0dc3bf9eacc4c99118b9d06e7a658bb383f666/R/OUwietools.R)
* ouch-based phylogenies use some legacy maticce functions



```r
intra_ancestor <- mrcaOUCH(c("Chlorurus_sordidus", "Hipposcarus_longiceps"), labrid$tree)
intramandibular <- paintBranches(intra_ancestor, labrid$tree, c("other","intramandibular"))
pharyngeal_ancestor<-mrcaOUCH(c("Bolbometopon_muricatum", "Sparisoma_radians"), labrid$tree)
pharyngeal <- paintBranches(pharyngeal_ancestor, labrid$tree, c("other","pharyngeal"))
two_shifts <- paintBranches(c(pharyngeal_ancestor, intra_ancestor), labrid$tree, 
c("wrasses", "pharyngeal", intramandibular") )

```

The ouch-trees can be converted back to ape trees in a way that can plot them, but for some reason break the fan-plot mode but not the standard phylogram plot mode.  Writing to a nexus file and reading back in solves the backwards convert problem, but does not write the branch labels (at least not currently, which are stored in `$regimes`).
