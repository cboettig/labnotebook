-   Finished implementation of simulation from saddle-node example
-   Implemented simulation from transition density for all three models

### Whoops

-   The change point model can't be summarized by the transition
    density, as this depends only on the time interval and not the
    absolute time. The nice description of being able to solve for the
    transition density when the transition occurs during the time
    interval specified is neither necessary nor applicable in this
    context!
