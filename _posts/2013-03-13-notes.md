## Multiple-uncertainty

* Created smaller version of table to simplify comparisons
* Switched to stationary policy comparisons only.  (Running out over longer time shifts total value a bit but doesn't amplify scale of the differences much)
* Larger noise amplifies the effects (compare [0.3 levels](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/commits/05637ec8845097c5059902a0f4f841343a44d9bc/inst/examples/smalltable.md) to [0.5 levels](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/05637ec8845097c5059902a0f4f841343a44d9bc/inst/examples/smalltable.mhttps://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/05637ec8845097c5059902a0f4f841343a44d9bc/inst/examples/smalltable.mdd))
* note that averaging over replicates gives rather consistent means.  The differences between [successive](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/05637ec8845097c5059902a0f4f841343a44d9bc/inst/examples/smalltable.md) [runs](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/bea28d918edccd7c7ab8b365cc12632166985e95/inst/examples/smalltable.md) of the algorithm give results agreeing to the tenths place at least.

## Tables of results

Note that columns represent the decision-maker's beliefs about uncertainty and rows represent the true uncertainty present in the simulation.

### logistic case

* Overcompensatory density dependence is tough on stock.  With given discounting (5%) and finite horizon (15 cycles) strategies act [conservatively](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/dc6fa3b8c1913cd771e72673083aa80ee733dc62/inst/examples/logistic_uniform.md).  Hmm, strange that deterministic case is equally effected..

* running with much weaker `r` to reduce overcompensatory impacts...

### Coding

Attempting to translate algorithm into Jim's native tongue (matlab) for feedback. [R version](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/fa4404e1719111b28aa23e388519db94c6f990db/R/multiple_uncertainty.R) vs [matlab](https://github.com/cboettig/multiple_uncertainty/blob/fa4404e1719111b28aa23e388519db94c6f990db/inst/matlab/multiple_uncertainty.m) not there yet...

## Reviewing

* Another review request, another review done.  


## Misc

* With Alistair, playing around with this HMM EM algorithm [gui11aume/HMMt](https://github.com/gui11aume/HMMt/). Also threw in a pull request with documentation.   grr, took a bit to understand what was going on with that paper.
