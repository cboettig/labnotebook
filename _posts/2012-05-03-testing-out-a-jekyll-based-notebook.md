I [am trying out Jekyll](http://carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html) as an alternative to Wordpress for powering this site and my open lab notebook. If you subscribe, the new RSS (atom) feed for the new notebook is at [http://carlboettiger.info/atom.xml](http://carlboettiger.info/atom.xml). I'd love to hear any feedback, good or bad, about the switch.  A recent post gives [my own reflections](http://www.carlboettiger.info/OpenScience/2012/05/01/Jekyll-vs-Wordpress.html).  The site's [source-code is available on github](https://github.com/cboettig/jekyll-source/).


## Navigating two platforms


The Wordpress site now lives at [http://carlboettiger.info/wordpress](http://carlboettiger.info/wordpress), while the new Jekyll site lives at the root domain: [http://carlboettiger.info](http://carlboettiger.info). All former links to the wordpress site will still work (though they are also available with "wordpress" in the url).  Enjoy the faster, simpler site.
