## Nonparametric-bayes

* Establishing chunck dependencies, simplifying and abstracting code. 

- still need to fix up Allen MCMC convergence when underlying model is Myers [10:18 am 2013/05/22](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/dce19f44d6dec779ba5a1a3e245365cdca4bb034)
- replicate runs on data from allen and myers model [08:39 pm 2013/05/21](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/f8a241c677583ef3b324f274f3846b08243ddacb)


### Clean code for complicated scripts


Pseudo-code somewhat captured by the chuncks.  Ideal would be:

* Define models
* Define parameters
* Simulate data
* Estimate MLE 
* Estimate under GPP
* Allen MCMC
* Ricker MCMC
* Myers MCMC
* Determine optimal policy for each...
* Simulation
* Graphs 

## A preponderance of preprint servers

Having sent in my review for IEE, do I also post it on the peerJ preprint?  File each complaint or suggestion as issue on the paper's Github repository?  Post a comment on the corresponding author's blogpost on the paper? In my own online notebook?  Oh, the reviewer's plight!  From review-recognition poverty to an embarassment of riches!

## Reading

* [Are unreasonably harsh reviews retarding the pace of coral reef science?](http://theseamonster.net/2013/05/are-unreasonably-harsh-reviewers-retarding-the-pace-of-coral-reef-science/)  I applaud the spirit of this piece.  When I saw the article, <span class="showtooltip" title="Coral reef baselines: how much macroalgae is natural?.  https://peerj.com/preprints/19/."><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/19/" rel="http://purl.org/spar/cito/discusses" >Bruno _et al._ (2013)</a></span> appear on PeerJ last week I thought to myself, "Ooh, looks like controversial stuff! Bravo for using a preprint server," so it is quite delightful to read the back story and confirm my guess.  Though I am a proponent of open peer review, I find the practice of posting anonymous peer reviews a bit ethically murky still.  


## Misc

* Trying to submit [knitcitations](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations) to CRAN; 
  R-devel has updated linewrapping requirements that brake roxygen2 
  [roxygen/125](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/issues/125), so have to correct
  `.Rd` files after the fact.  

* My ans: [Open data vs Linked data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/522) on opendata.stackexchange
opendata SO launches public beta


* [Why people don't use WADL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1312087/)
  Basically we can accomplish structure much better by having well-defined
  media types.  We can define the schema of the json or xml file we 
  return, [^1] and then the application knows what to expect and what it 
  can do with the data.  This is far more useful than just having a programmatic
  version of the API calls in the native language ("client objects").  Seems like
  REST was supposed to make such things obsolete, and to make deploying the API
  far simpler than it was in SOAP (which provides WSDL).  

* An interesting discussion on [using mediatypes for REST
  APIs](http://barelyenough.org/blog/2008/05/versioning-rest-web-services/),
  which might be referred to as the
  [HATEOAS](http://barelyenough.org/blog/2007/05/hypermedia-as-the-engine-of-application-state/)
  approach:

> which basically means that responses from the server will be documents that include URIs to everything you can do next

hmm, a powerful idea.

[^1]: yes, JSON has schemas too. wow.
