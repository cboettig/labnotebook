In keeping this open lab notebook, I have sought to address three goals
(in addition to all the traditional reasons for keeping a lab notebook)

1. Provide an educational resource 
2. Experiment with scientific infrastructure and tools for sharing and replicating research
3. Facilitate the rapid and open dissemination of scientific research

which are coincidentally evocative of [NSF's Broader
Impacts](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07046/nsf07046.jsp) areas.
In this series of posts I plan to explore and illustrate some of
my experiments to address these goals through various web-based tools
available for an open notebook platform.  Many of these have
been documented in the notebook itself as I experiment with them (see
[#notebook-technology](http://www.carlboettiger.info/tags.html#notebook-technology)).
Not all of those experiments pan out and older tools and techniques
are often replaced with newer ones as I explore, and these posts are
usually more technical notes written to help me think through and remember
what I'm trying out.  In order to provide a more accessible snapshot of
notebook features, I thought it might be helpful to write a series of
posts describing these tools and techniques.



Below is an index of posts in this theme that I will continue to 
update as I have a chance to finish them.  If there's anything about
the notebook that you'd like to hear more about, feel free to suggest
it in the comments.
