## Computational tricks

* [tables in github markdown via knitr](https://gist.github.com/2050761). clever
* [Getting custom C/C++ CUDA working in R](http://possiblybrainful.blogspot.com/2011/08/using-gpu-in-r-scripts.html)


## Data management and sharing solutions for large files

* NERSC uses [globus online](https://www.globusonline.org/) for interface for transferring terabytes/hr, pretty clever. NERSC also enables [web hosting to share data](http://www.nersc.gov/users/data-and-networking/sharing-data/).

* Software-Carpentry style [Data management](software-carpentry.org/4_0/data/mgmt/) a nice start. An open solution could stick the data on figshare (or elsewhere), write the readmes in markdown and keep them on github with links to the data.

## Misc

* A collection of [Open Science challenges from p2pU](http://pad.p2pu.org/p/opensciencecontent)
* A nice [NY Times piece on Thrun & large-scale teaching](www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/education/moocs-large-courses-open-to-all-topple-campus-walls.html?pagewanted=all)
