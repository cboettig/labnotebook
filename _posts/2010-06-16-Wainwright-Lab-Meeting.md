Presented a revised version of my talk for Evolution 2010, focusing on
the inadequacy of information-criteria heuristics for model choice in
phylogenetic comparative methods and presenting the likelihood-ratio
based approach I've been working on. Much better received this time.
(The last two weeks have been pretty dedicated to preparing for the
upcoming conferences, mostly for this presentation, so not much in the
way of new research. Will be able to return to new stuff in July,
following iEvoBio).
