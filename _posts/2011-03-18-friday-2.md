## Notes from:


Sam Price's Practice Job Talk for Hull, UK, next week, in Wainwright lab:

	
* Diversification of mammals predated KT event(Bininda-Emonds _et. al._ 2007) (also considerably later, but not right after)
* Ecological shift in wrasses to parrotfishes(Price _et. al._ 2010). No evidence of elevate rates of evolution.  But, scraping parrotfishes do show difference (starting from base of Hipposcarus-Scarus common ancestor).
* Multiple transitions to/from reef living. 2x faster on coral reefs!  (Price _et. al._ 2011)
* In prep: Omnivores trophic strategy (transitions are always via omnivore).  Carnivore->omnivore->herbivore stronger pathway.  Herbivores diversify fast, Omnivores slowest, a transition group.(Price & Hopkins in prep)


my Qs 
* Mass -- how do you weight it (by species number)?  presumably in log.
* Nice stories, all are ecological shifts.  Is there a trend/direction? More ambitious/clearer?  What's the general pattern and story


**Approach**: Database collection.  Trait databases.  Phylogeny building, time calibration.  Comparative methods.



	
* Plan: Continue with approach, apply to conservation (>>how??) & teaching students through applied questions.


**Future Directions**


* Project 1: Increase breath of taxa.  Use of fossils.  Get real fancy with fossil traits: 3D GIS approach on fossils
* Project 2: Spatial & Climate change.  wow.  application?
* Project 3:  Host shifting on parasites -- great data is available.  Phylo distance propto shifting rate?  breakdown by range overlap, parasite type, transmission, etc


Other group comments


### Peter: Applied Evolution really strong pitch: under-utilized and very powerful. 


Peter: Sell interesting bio questions and real expertise
Matt on reef paper: also is applied: what enviro has less extinction
