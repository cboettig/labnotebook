## R packages





	
  * Trying to build Windows binaries for R packages using [win-builder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/) service.

	
  * First have to get R CMD check working.  Check runs in --vanilla mode so have to tell it where libraries are.  Created the file ~/.R/check.Renviron containing the line: R_LIBS="/home/cboettig/R/packages" seems to do the trick.

	
  * Successfully built windows binaries for RMendeley package (pre-release, still in development). [Download](https://github.com/downloads/cboettig/RMendeley/RMendeley_0.1-1.zip) the binaries from github.

	
  * Matt successfully installed [CUDA](http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-40) on zero (2.6, looks like we might want 3.0 or 4.0 -- if only they could organize their site better...).  Now, do we pay for an academic license of [CULA](http://www.culatools.com/) tools and start playing with [gputools](http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/brainarray/rgpgpu/)?  A few more specialized GPU R packages are on the [HPC taskview](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html).




## Warning Signals





	
  * Troubleshooting MCMC -- resolved some minor issues from last night's run.  Seems to be up and running now (on zero, pid 14301, nice 5), we'll see if we get successful output...

Re-running with smaller step increments on m (1/20th of value), see if the posterior is smaller).
Running with four chains, still 1e5 steps, nice 18.  
Running with four chains, 1e6 steps, nice 19.  
	
  * Running longer versions of sampling effect (have enough replicates to get smooth distributions), on zero, nice 19


  * Can represent these as [ROC Curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic), showing the result of 20, 50, 100, and 200 data points.

  * Working on manuscript edits, 4:30p - ??




## Teaching


Teaching second half of phylogenetics comparative methods tutorial in R in core today.  Using my [Bodega curriculum](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Continuous_Character_Evolution_%28Boettiger%29_2011), covered up through model choice.  3p-4:30p.


## Reading





	
  * Ooh: Stack _et. al._ 2011

	
  * Losos's address from Evolution last year, out in Am Nat.   (Losos, 2011)

	
  * Cass pulled out this gem from Bruce Alberts: (Alberts, 2005)

	
  * Daniel says peer review should be public (Mietchen, 2011)

	
  * Wow, once again Jeremy really writes about some great stuff on Oikos blog.  Just a read [a piece after my own heart](http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/ignorance-is-bliss-sometimes/) on the meaning of "random" in ecology.  I think I need to cut back, I might be addicted.





##  To Do 


Things I haven't gotten to today.  Should add these to their github repositories issues trackers.  



	
  * Dryad R package -- search metadata.  Scott is taking a whack at this one.  

	
  * Treebase support for downloading character matrices.  Should be quick. one day

	
  * Treebase writeup

	
  * SocialR -- integrate Rflickr, twitteR, begin github api, improved tracking of relevant code and data

...
