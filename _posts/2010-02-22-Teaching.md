GTC Session: Student Centered Learning: Successes, Failures and Strategies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Gabrielle and I facilitated a GTC section on Student-Centered
    learning. Details in the [GTC blog
    post](http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com/2010/02/student-centered-learning-successes.html "http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com/2010/02/student-centered-learning-successes.html").
    Small group of about a dozen of us, still worked to break into four
    groups for the discussion section. Overall went very well, don't
    have a lot of comments to add about the experience or things I'd do
    differently. Did get some positive feedback and comments that we
    could have used much more time to explore these ideas! Certainly the
    hour seems to fly by rather than drag on in this style. I was
    impressed by one group's method of summarizing there discussion by
    having each member share a point; very organized and egalitarian.

-   Will try and add a Mendeley library link to the Student Centered
    Learning literature here when I get a chance. Maybe should add one
    to the GTC blog too. Should add notes from the group sections also.
