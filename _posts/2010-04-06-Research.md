-   Seem to have successfully fixed the behavior when getting over
    parameterized models. See diffs against the git log for details.

-   Will work on acceleration of code (avoiding refitting), meanwhile a
    little more trouble shooting and queuing some long runs.

-   ace function fails on certain data sets for unknown reasons. Think
    rewriting this from scratch will be an important step.

### Mixture Models in Bayesian context

-   Josh sent me this
    [paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3085902 "http://www.jstor.org/stable/3085902")
    regarding our discussion on model choice in Bayesian context last
    Friday.

Workstation
-----------

-   Settled on workstation, completed final pricing adjustments. Now
    seeking
    [approval](/images/e/e7/Myworkstation.pdf "Myworkstation.pdf") from
    Krell / CSGF.

Misc / Reading
--------------

#### [McElreath's Class](http://xcelab.net/rm/?p=432 "http://xcelab.net/rm/?p=432")

-   Looks like a fantastic class on model choice, should sit in. Read
    through the slides for weeks 1 & 2 so far. Every practicing
    ecologist should read the [week 2
    presentation](http://xcelab.net/rm/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/week2.pdf "http://xcelab.net/rm/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/week2.pdf").

    Exciting stuff, interesting what these approaches can tell us about
    the way we do science.

    but why exclusive membership? How about

    favorite quote:

"If shoestores operated like scientists trading ideas, first Alice and
Bob would need to get to know one another, maybe go for a few beers in a
nearby bar. Only then would Alice finally say “you know, I’m looking for
some shoes”. After a pause, and a few more beers, Bob would say “You
know what, I just happen to have some shoes I’m looking to sell”. Every
working scientist recognizes this dance; I know scientists who worry
less about selling their house than they do about exchanging scientific
information."
