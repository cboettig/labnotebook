-   Wasn't taking the Jacobian of the transition terms. Fixes the
    unstable behavior and disagreement between simulations and theory.
-   Other note: the "hastings.c" model can trivially be obtained from
    the standard crowley-form metapopulation model by taking b\_1 = 0.

For the crowley class of models at least, seems that while the two-step
vs one-step involved different dynamics, this difference exists only in
transients while equilbrium covariances agree.

#### Beetle dynamics

-   Variances aren't exactly in agreement, though much closer.
    Simulations with 30 replicates a piece for speed, will rerun for
    finer resolution on variances comparisons.
-   Wondering what parameter regimes will make most pronounced
    difference.
