## Stuck on many things

* Have not correctly defined the recursion in the sequential updating approach.  Can I really calculate $P(y_3 | (y2 | y_1))$ in place of $P(y_3 | y2, y1)$? e.g. instead of calculating:

$$V_3 = K(y_3, y_3) - K(y_{1:2}, y_3) K(y_{1:2}, y_{1:2})^{-1} ) K(y_3, y_{1:2}) $$

Is there some scalar $v_2$ such that 

$$V_3 = K(y_3, y_3) - K(y_{1:2}, y_3) K(y_3, y_{1:2}) / v_2$$

e.g. a term like: 

$$V_2 = K(y_2, y_2) - K(y_1, y_2) K(y_1, y_1)^{-1} ) K(y_2, y_1) $$

and a similar recursion for the mean?

* Cannot get posterior covariance matrix from kernlab's `gausspr`.  Can this be reconstructed from `alpha`? ([question posted to cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/43713/how-do-i-access-or-compute-the-posterior-covariance-matrix-returned-by-kernlab))
* Likelihood optimization does not handle the noise term.  Examples in Rasmussen and Wiliams suggest this should work. (See commit log below)


### nonparametric-bayes log

- re-run example with updated plots, but otherwise as before. [07:40 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/73396d797b8398f25dcfe8307befafb7546c1097)
- Question on how to get the covariance matrix back from the kernlab gausspr method. [07:39 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/80fcefbc391e5d75fa63300f95e60c98af7bcb2c)
- Attempted to fix the sequential method example.

Still incorrect.  See sequential-method.Rmd [07:37 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/01307f5c36060a07fdbb9f3ba6b83b8660f88103)
- Attempting to write the sequential method algorithm.

Not correct at the moment, need to understand the recursion properly. [07:36 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/e732f74985def53677478f6f0e10e8f931201252)
- Stick with direct method.

Current version of sequential method is not correct. [07:34 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/14821223d59b6f68e9e0b6f962476b8c5119e2ce)
- Updated hyperparameter-optimization example

Shows that we can estimate l appropriately but fails to get sigma_n; instead estimating the upper boundary. [07:32 pm 2012/11/15](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/commit/c28d09929f3765fff8a7b82e2d9b84d2f9cc8fa6)
