-   Testing power code. currently null and test distributions of
    likelihood scores are distinguishable even for small beta on the
    long time scale. See [code for
    run](http://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/e47014434e8924ee586be6d5c141c914970a9bd4/demos/warning_example2.R "http://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/blob/e47014434e8924ee586be6d5c141c914970a9bd4/demos/warning_example2.R").

-   running on shorter timescale. Note that parameters match but small
    code differences in repository code on the last commit since I
    committed the version on the local machine (my laptop, for
    development) but ran a slightly tweaked code (typo in reps vs nboot,
    .o1), on the production server.

Same string of values, shorter timescale. First four values of beta are
.001, .01, .5, 1, for a length of time T=50. Will have to quantify
detection of the rate of change vs magnitude of change, and also
evaluate power analyses of change point.
