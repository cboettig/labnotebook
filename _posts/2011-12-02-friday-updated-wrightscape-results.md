Consider two simulated datasets, one under a release of constraint (left) one under an increase in sigma (right).  Can we correctly discriminate between these models?

Parameter differences:

Likelihood differences:

**Yup**.

Repeated with effect-size scaled to be roughly equivalent for both traits.  Wondering if it's easier to plot parameters out separately like this.  Error bars show median and 25/75 % quantile range, with barplots showing the means (note that high outliers makes mean often larger than median).

Note that the resulting likelihood differences are less dramatic in the sigma-simulation trait when it's variance is more comparable to the alpha example:
