Spent Monday and Tuesday visiting Santa Cruz, where I have recently accepted a post-doctoral position with [Steve Munch](http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/people/munch.html), [Marc Mangel](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~msmangel/), and [Alec MacCall](http://swfsc.noaa.gov/staff.aspx?id=689).  I will be based primarily at the National Marine Fisheries Service building, here:

Five fantastic years of graduate school are coming to an end:  I will start officially later this fall, where I will

> join an exciting team of ecologists and applied mathematicians who work collaboratively on cutting-edge problems in ecological and evolutionary modeling through the [Center for Stock Assessment Research](http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~msmangel/CSTAR.html).  I will work with us to develop non-parametric approaches to ecosystem-based management based on semi-parametric Bayesian methods for nonlinear time-series modeling

or so the job description goes.  I am looking forward to it.
