Notes from [Alex Pfaff](http://www.duke.edu/~asp9/cv&bio.html) talk at UTK (during my visit for pdg-control meeting).





  * average impact vs differential impact -- must compare against what would have happened to the area if unprotected (at current time/short-timescale, or in future?)  


  * Proximity is not a good proxy of similarity (i.e. bc we protect steep slopes but farm the flat land nearby)


  * Instead use simple metrics available in GIS layers - distance from nearest road, etc.


  * Multi-use conservation works better.  Why?  




    1. More likely to establish protection in higher-threat areas (i.e. nearer a city)


    2. Possibly better enforcement when local interest has a stake (i.e. indigenous farmers reporting illegal logging)




  * Matching areas subsets data.  Why ignore some of the data instead of just regressions on all effects?  Complexity of regressions, inaccuracies of those assumptions, lack of overlap in areas...



(Joppa & Pfaff, 2010)
