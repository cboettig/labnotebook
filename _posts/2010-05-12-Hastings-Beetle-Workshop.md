[Bob
Costantino](http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/Bob_Costantino/cos1.html "http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/Bob_Costantino/cos1.html")
and [Brett
Melbourne](http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/melbourne/ "http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/melbourne/")
are joining us for the next two days to talk about stochastic population
dynamics in *Tribolium.*

-   Morning Session, 9a - 11a
    -   Outline the individual based model, toolbox

-   Group lunch, noon-1:30
-   My lab Presentation, 2p-3p
    -   Present multidimensional linear noise approximation approach to
        characterizing the demographically stochastic *key class.*

-   Afternoon session, 3p-4p
    -   Follow-up on understanding noise propagation in age structure
        dynamics.

-   ( Phylogenetics Workshop, 4-6:30)
-   Group dinner 7:00-9:00

(Details to be transcribed still)

### Presentation

-   Motivation: qualitative differences from noise -- geometric mean
    fitness
-   Why demographic noise is often negligible
-   Why it isn't
    -   Enhancement
    -   Inflation
    -   transient bimodality

-   Notion of key class in age structured model
    -   Crowley-based model simulation
    -   Analytic approximation

-   Insights from linear noise approximation
-   Challenges: inference based and computationally based difficulties.
