## Research

* consolidate and revise EWS text(?)
* replies to Luke and Brian on model choice

## Notebook meta

* fix google-analytics plugin (still needs to get toggle working?)
* tests of notebook-parsing.Rmd.  New errors on `;` somehow in straight XML parsing, ignoring for the moment.
* Opened a few new issues around improving site semantics. (#59, #60) 

## ropensci

* Resubmit rfishbase -- silently load to local, not global namespace.  Updated data cache (and ASCII-ify and compress).  
Also replaced `data` loading with `system.file("data", "fishbase.rda", package="fishbase")`. 
ASCII-only .rda is very annoying.  Should work around this with alternative data file?  

* Resubmit rfigshare -- punt on 3.0.0 compatible vignette for the moment
* knitcitations: Fix the stupid disambiguation for inline citations (took way too long).
