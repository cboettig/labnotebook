Not much chance for progress.

-   11-noon (I was interviewed by Science Careers reporter).
-   noon-1 Lunch w/ John Huelsenbeck. Good perspective on having formula
    representation of models rather than on/off switch for parameters!
    Will have to implement eventually in the phylogenetics project.
-   1-1:30 Wainwrighters lunch meeting.
-   1:30-3:30 prep Monte Carlo for teaching non-majors evolution course
    -- case study on mimicry and levels of selection. Presenting Monday,
    we'll see how it goes in [User:Carl\_Boettiger/Notebook/Teaching]
-   4-6 Phylogenetics discussion group (followed by CPB happy hour =
    more phylogenetics discussion). Working out correlated trait
    evolution model for suction index?
