Looking at ways to visually explain receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves.  Should probably be done in a way that maps the curves to the points along the curve.  May make a nice graphic but perhaps unnecessary.

Perhaps simpler to present as single panel

Integrating the test distribution to the left instead of the right gives the error rate (Type I/Type II errors, False Alarms/Missed Events):

## Analyses





	
  * Maximization algorithm failing at initial conditions on deut2

	
  * Re-running deut1 and deut3 with more replicates and finer resolution on the effect of increased sampling.




## Misc





	
  * Posted Evolution conference notes.

	
  * Still have to post ievobio notes.
