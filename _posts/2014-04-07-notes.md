ropensci
--------



Working on proposal.  Discussion of section 2: other players in the domain (or rather, the many community interfaces with rOpenSci).


other
-----

- Discussion with Hadley re: API testing and `test_if` functionality, see [testthat/141](https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/141#issuecomment-39737034).

- Related with Hadley discussion on handling tests and keys for API packages, [httr/93](https://github.com/hadley/httr/issues/93)

- [Software Carpentry developing R lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/04/novice-r-discussion-summary.html)

rfishbase
---------

Add FAO areas (from 04/05), see [rfishbase/20](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/issues/20)


EML
----

- Discussion of unit handling, feedback from Karen. [EML/12](https://github.com/ropensci/EML/issues/12#issuecomment-39697171)

- Need to update creation of filenames for csv files following Matt's advice: [EML/106](https://github.com/ropensci/EML/issues/106)

- No luck with `XMLSchema::readSchema` parsing the measurement unit schema definitions in [STMML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cboettig/eml/master/stmml.xsd)

```r
> XMLSchema::readSchema("../stmml.xsd")
Error in FUN(X[[1L]], ...) :
  formal argument "localElements" matched by multiple actual arguments
```




misc/reading
-------------

- teary: discuss interviews. send copy of materials for archive.
- review request EcoLet
- follow-up emails from Wisconsin visit.  Follow-up reading:



- [RDCEP](http://www.rdcep.org/people)

- Here's the [RDCEP robust control paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2370657)

- Here are two papers on the value of experimentation, [1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2007.00016.x/abstract;jsessionid=29F390887AD667C409ACF504ECB50B34.f02t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticate), [2](
http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Macroeconomics/hansen-080926.pdf).  Key references are the two papers by V. Wieland cited there.  Steve and Buz discussed one of these in ["Panceas" paper](
http://www.pnas.org/content/104/39/15206.full.pdf+html)

-  Here's a link to the BDW Brookings paper which has an interesting discussion by [Sargent and Sims](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/spring%202003/2003a_bpea_brock.pdf)

- [This one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407605002277) proposes an approach to reporting to policy makers that respects uncertainties

- Here is one we did for the World Bank to deal with [uncertainties in growth policy](http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1093/wber/15.2.229?journalCode=wber)

- Since optimal control and even robust control can lead to controls that are complicated functions of the state vector, there's a literature in applications to central banking that stresses “simple rules”, here's a [recent example](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393207000591) from our shop that has lots of references,

- Finally, on EWS's, there's a general multivariate mathematical approach to variance-convariance matrix approaches to EWS's in the Mathematical Appendix to this paper by [Biggs et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/3/826.short)
