I strive for a transparent and reproducible research process.  My lab notebooks are kept on an open wiki (via [OpenWetWare](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Carl_Boettiger)).  I curate the literature I read into several public lists ([Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carl-boettiger)), maintain my research source code and simulations on a collective database for open source development ([Github](http://github.com/cboettig)),  and am active on academic forums and mailing lists. These web-based tools make a largely automated, interlinked archive of my work I can search, update and share easily.  They have native social media functionality which helps me connect to related research and extend my impact.

My lab notebooks haven't yet been migrated to this site.  Currently they can still be found on OpenWetWare.  I may consider migrating them here in the future.
