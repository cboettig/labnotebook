### Reading


  * GrrlScientist [disagrees](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/apr/19/1) with M. Nielsen (and I add my 2c: Open Science might not give you the credit you need to get a job in today's science culture, but hey, in all probability, neither will the traditional strategy, so have fun).
  * _Nature_ says: [Too many PhDs](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110419/full/472276a.html)
  * Some [useful tools](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9215504/22_free_tools_for_data_visualization_and_analysis?taxonomyName=Applications&taxonomyId=18) for data visualization: particularly want to try:[ Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/public/tour/index.html), [Gephi](http://gephi.org/), [DataViz](http://www.dataviz.org/)
  * Mendeley groups don't display (or share) stars.  Can only sort A-Z or by most recent.  need to make my Mendeley tags more useful. No luck getting the mendeley wp-plugin working.  Notes on Mendeley articles are dropped from the copy when adding it to a group (but remain in the personal collection).
  * Discussing tree-base api with Rutger.  Suggested starting by looking into [RSS/RDF for R](http://biostar.stackexchange.com/questions/2069/how-do-i-import-rdf-data-into-r)
  * Huh, you can[ use your domain](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/using-your-own-url-as-your-openid/) as an openid
  * New article from Scheffer lab out in _Oikos_ on abrupt regime shifts, though not in trying to forecast them.  Haven't given a careful read but looks like a very nice model-driven treatment.  (Hilt _et. al._ 2011)
  * Overview of bet-hedging in empirical systems from PRSB (Simons, 2011).  And it looks like Jamie's selected to discuss this one in Baskett lab meeting tomorrow.
  * Structural equation modeling and multivariate comparative methods in PNAS, for PDG discussion this week: (Santos & Cannatella, 2011)



## Writing

  * Working on restructuring phylogenetics likelihood manuscript.  Almost there, sending updated version to Yaniv.
  * Final scheduling for Felsenstein's visit.

### Arithmetic
	
  * Began testing Rrdf package.
  * reviewing my implementation of OpenMP compiling in stochastic population dynamics code.  Was functional at this [earlier stage](https://github.com/cboettig/structured-populations/commit/2473d86dfc8fdc17f9a0ed539d11c44a01928b21), since has been disabled in that package (mostly since looping over simulations with snowfall R package instead).


Also, Joe Felsenstein arrives today, meeting him at the airport around 5pm before dinner with the usual suspects.  Looking forward to the seminar and banquet tomorrow.
