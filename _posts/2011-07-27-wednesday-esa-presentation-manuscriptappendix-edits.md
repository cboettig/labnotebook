## Misc morning


* Site trouble, again.  requested migrating servers.  Done.  hope we're more stable now.
* Checking in with Peter about migrating site domain.  Sent request to Matt.
* Looking over NERSC PI [application](https://nim.nersc.gov/ercap_menu.php), see [first allocation](http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/first-allocation/) instructions.  Emailed Mary Ann w/ questions on forms.
* [SMB 2012](http://nimbios.org/SMB2012/) is at NIMBioS!
* Nick to join ropensci.  Coordinating launch, advisers, etc.   Karthik and Scott have done a great job editing my intro post and sprucing up the site.  more later.
* wp-minify [messes up certain graphics](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/block-quote-missing-quotation-graphic?replies=4#post-2229639), like the quotations in this theme.  [better-wordpress-minify](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bwp-minify/) is, well, better.



## Reading


* Sam just pointed out the [MOTMOT package on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/motmot/index.html) and it's paper in Methods in Ecology and Evolution Thomas & Freckleton, 2012.  A "Medusa" for traits algorithm.  Does a handful of different BM-like models (because it's always easier to transform the tree than to actually solve a new likelihood equation).  Rather worried about the proliferation of these non-Bayesian approaches when they don't compute confidence intervals.
* Clever! [wordclouds](http://onertipaday.blogspot.com/2011/07/word-cloud-in-r.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OneRTipADay+%28One+R+Tip+A+Day%29) in R.


### Upcoming conferences

* DataCite [conference](http://datacite2011.eventbrite.com/), Berekely, 24-25 of August. (Wed-Thurs)
* Maybe: the Santa Barbara  for [EIM 2011](https://eim.ecoinformatics.org/eim2011) is the 28-29 September, though I'd probably spend 27 & 30th on the train.  (Tues-Fri).  Could probably couple this with a chance to visit some of the labs in Santa Barbara, re post-doc options, etc.  Should speak to Alan about this.



Next year:

* Science Online: January, sometime
* Evolution: Ottawa, Ontario, Canada - July 6-10
* CSGF: not scheduled
* SMB: Knoxville, TN: July 26-28
* ESA: Portland, OR, August 5 – Friday, August 10, 2012

## ESA presentation

Still working on this, see scripts and slides for details.

Do I have time to do explain ROC curves, or stick with parameter distributions?
