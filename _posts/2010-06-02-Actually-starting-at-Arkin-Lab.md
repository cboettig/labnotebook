### Meeting with M. Samoilov

-   Kurtz Theorems: two limits, timescale and system size, often taken
    in the wrong order in practice.
-   Einstein-Smoluchowski debate regarding Langevin correspondence to
    Ito vs Statonvich representations resolved: [theorem]. (Statonvich
    is the more natural interpretation of the way in which we measure
    data to compare to Langevin. Of course Ito and Stratonvich can be
    mapped back and forth anyway).
-   Of course this difference doesn't exist, and nothing goes wrong / no
    stochastic surprises if dynamics are linear.
-   Necessary limits of applicability not often checked in SDE famework.
-   Deterministic limit often works better than these limits would
    imply, as the same deterministic equation arises from multiple cases
-   Hamiltonian-Jacobi derivation sheds some light on why deterministic
    result is more general (requires fewer assumptions/weaker limits
    than SDE approach)
-   Intrinsic + extrinsic noise is hard. Environmental noise poorly
    defined, hard to make physical. Can be incorporated into the master
    equation directly in a more meaningful way, still very hard problem.
    Still, environmental noise often not needed to capture the behavior
    once we go back to original master equation.
-   References and examples to come.
