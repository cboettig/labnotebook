Really high sampling runs (20000 pts) still don't seem to show any improvement in deut3 dataset summary statistics, perhaps it is the window size.  testing by launching deut_replot.R, n5 on zero, 500, 1000, 2000 on a fixed windowsize of 60, see how it compares to the half window.  probably because is such a weak signal.  

running drake tau sampling with corrected (1/2 length) windowsizes.  -- destroys any improvement in indicators:

Exploring the impact of windowsize on deut3 data now (5, 10, 25, 50 size on 500 pts, see [code](https://github.com/cboettig/warningsignals/blob/6ada6a0822be7251fd7da545e6f19b99df382f92/demo/replot.R)):

For completed outputs from yesterday: running corrected windowing, and uploading from farm:

![caco3 on c0-2 done:]( http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6001/5910169898_f8206f1d35_o.png )

- Daphnia I9 with LTC still running on C0-23
- Writing code to assemble manuscript figures.  Preliminary Figures 3 & 4 finally done.  Probably need to add stable system still.
