title: Lunch with Wainwright Lab
---






 








Friday lunch with Wainwright lab continues to be a very useful chance to
bounce ideas off of lab members with an excellent grasp of both the
models involved and the real biology, morphology and evolution in
question. Today's discussion hit several topics.

-   **Should regime transitions be restricted to nodes?** The general
    consensus was **No.** On one hand, the position of nodes may contain
    information about the timing of an actual environmental change
    responsible for a regime shift. On the other hand: (1) the exact
    temporal position of the node is uncertain anyway, as it comes from
    inference of the tree, (2) the evolutionary response may occur
    immediately after or before the actual position of the node, and
    indeed it may be interesting to say which it is, (3) this ignores
    information about the branch lengths, and that transitions are more
    likely to occur on longer branches (4) this ignores the fact that
    many more nodes exist than are inferred, but are absent from the
    phylogeny because the lineage subsequently goes extinct. That said,
    restricting transitions to nodes seems like a reasonable place to
    start.

-   **log transforming data.** This is a minor comment, which we might
    submit as a note to Evolution. While nondimensionalizing data is
    good, this makes interpreting the Brownian motion model more
    challenging, as the average size continues to increase. The problem
    is slightly remedied by the OU process, in which the average size
    increases only until the stationary distribution is reached.
    Discussion seemed encouraging and now I need to think of how to
    usefully illustrate the concern in four or fewer figures...

-   **Model choice and AIC scores** This is another note I'm preparing
    to submit. The correct way to choose between BM and OU models may
    not be as simple as AIC, as any simulation can explore. Accurately
    characterizing false-positive rates may be more informative and is
    easily done using existing methods and software. The degree of error
    will be particular to the tree topology, but this kind of analysis
    could be performed for each data set automatically.
