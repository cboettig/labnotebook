### My experiment with open science: Why the benefits of sharing go beyond source code

The practice and philosophy of open source run deep within the iEvoBio
community. Sharing source code has made software development faster and
more reliable. Reuse helps catch errors, develop standards, provide more
extensible platforms and ensure scientific reproducibility. It has
helped foster a community that can tackle problems that would be
impossible for single labs. Can an “open-source” approach benefit other
elements of research? I discuss how I am fostering open science
throughout my research process from my reading, through code
development, my lab notebook to feedback and conversation. I highlight
three themes that I have found most valuable: (1) Facilitating access
and reuse. Content that is legally and practically accessible makes for
more reproducible science, better error checking, and farther impact as
more people may see or build upon it. (2) Linking data. In a web-native
environment, everything can be archived, linked, tagged with keywords
and searched. In this way, my content can connect to that of other
researchers working on similar questions, data, articles or algorthms.
(3) Networking people. The most successful tools not only link data but
link people. This provides a network of expertise, a filter of
exponentially growing amounts of information, and a source of
inspiration and collaboration. I will briefly describe four tools that
embrace this approach in different elements of my own research.

**Literature** (using
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carl-boettiger "http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carl-boettiger")):
My bibliographies for each topic become publicly visible collections.
When other researchers do the same, the content is automatically linked
to see how many people in my field are reading what articles, authors,
journals and also generates recommendations. This tool also provides a
network of contacts, following other public collections or
collaboratively adding to one.

**Code Development** (using
[Github](http://www.github.com/cboettig "http://www.github.com/cboettig")):
My code development is regularly committed to a public version
management repository. One can follow line by line changes, view my
commit log and visualize branches and merges in the project. The code
can be downloaded in the state it was at any point in its history to
replicate my work and be reused in other projects. Github’s social
coding tools connects me to similar researchers whose work I can follow,
pose questions or begin a direct collaboration.

**Lab Notebook** (using
[OpenWetWare](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Carl_Boettiger/Notebook/Comparative_Phylogenetics "http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Carl_Boettiger/Notebook/Comparative_Phylogenetics")):
I keep a daily online lab notebook on a community wiki. This binds and
shares all elements of my work, from readings and meetings to
mathematical derivations and simulations. Graphs, code snippets,
spreadsheets, references, and even conversations can be embedded
directly into the notebook. I can search the complete text, and organize
by tags, links, and the automatic versioning archive. This facilitate
sharing my work with collaborators, and has helped me discover new
datasets and collaborations from other users on the site.

**Feedback** (using
[uservoice](http://phylogenetics.uservoice.com/forums/43843-general?lang=en&utm_campaign=Widgets&utm_content=tab-widget&utm_medium=widget&utm_source=phylogenetics.uservoice.com "http://phylogenetics.uservoice.com/forums/43843-general?lang=en&utm_campaign=Widgets&utm_content=tab-widget&utm_medium=widget&utm_source=phylogenetics.uservoice.com")
and
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134583/looking-for-fast-algorithm-to-find-distance-between-two-nodes-in-binary-tree "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134583/looking-for-fast-algorithm-to-find-distance-between-two-nodes-in-binary-tree")):
Before forums, asking a question meant knowing someone who knows the
answer. Online tools make it possible to ask questions to particular
expertise groups. Questions and replies can be tagged, linked, and
searched; cites automatically search for existing similar questions.
They can also be rated, drawing more focus to those with more value to
the community, and contributions can be tracked and rewarded, while
profiles help identify contributors and provide elements of a human
network. This is also well adapted to feedback between users and
developers.

I find this approach saves time as it integrates naturally into my
workflow. It reduces errors through greater transparency and review. It
increases quality through better access to expert advice and building on
established work. It increases impact by connecting to other data and
being amplified by other researchers in the network. The more
researchers adopt these approaches, the more effective they’ll become.

### Call For Lightning Talks

"Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes. They are ideal
for drawing the attention of the audience to new developments, tools,
and resources, or to subsequent events where more in-depth information
can be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more information
([http://ievobio.org/faq.html\#lightning](http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning "http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning")).
Lightning talks will be part of the more interactive afternoon program
on both conference days.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at advancing
research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, including new
tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data analysis, and
visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long. The
abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject. Reviewers
will judge whether a submission is within scope of the conference (see
above). If applicable, the abstract must also state the license and give
the URL where the source code is available so reviewers can verify that
the open-source requirement(\*) is met."
