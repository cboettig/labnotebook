## Nonparametric-bayes

* Finishing up parametric vs nonparametric Bayes comparison runs
* Need to add parametric Bayesian mean to the state-space diagram, fig 1
* Compare with uniform priors on inverse standard deviations (precision)
* Sensitivity analysis
* mcmc convergence analysis for both Bayesian approaches
* See allen.md example scripts in BUGS/, adapted to post soon




### Code tricks 

**Plotting tricks**

* Selecting the order in the simulation legend requires declaring the model types as an ordered factor instead of a character,

```r
dt$method = factor(dt$method, ordered=TRUE, levels=names(OPT))
```

and then set custom colors and match colors to the desired factor labels with `scale_colour_manual`, and override `alpha` for legends,

```r
ggplot(dt) + 
  geom_line(aes(time, fishstock, group=interaction(reps,method), color=method), alpha=.1) +
    scale_colour_manual(values=colorkey, guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
```

* Avoid having density plots appear as crude polygons using `stat_density` instead of `geom_density` and set `geom` to path.  Need a ymax (not clear why?) or set `position="identity"` as shown,:

```r
ggplot(posteriors, aes(value)) + stat_density(geom="path", position="identity", alpha=0.7)
```


* [initialize ssh-agent in .bashrc](https://gist.github.com/bluegraybox/1998129)
* Or for single session:  `ssh-agent bash`, `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rda`




### Misc 

* whoops, got into discussion of a fictional world of data publishing in the [comments at dynamicecology](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/selective-journals-vs-social-networks-alternative-ways-of-filtering-the-literature-or-po-tay-to-po-tah-to/#comment-15439)
