Digging through some old stuff in the course of correspondance on related issues, I came across a few outstanding puzzles I've been meaning to wrap up one day:

- [Drift effecs -- some difficulties](http://carlboettiger.info/2009/08/25/drift-effects.html)
- [Waiting Time](http://carlboettiger.info/2010/04/20/waiting-time.html)

and some actual results that could deserve some renewed attention too.  

- [Phase 1](http://carlboettiger.info/2009/07/28/branching-times.html)
- [Routes to branching](http://carlboettiger.info/2011/01/06/two-routes-to-adaptive-branching.html)

Also raises an interesting new question that could be addressed in this context: can we formulate a similar approach to the stochastic escape from an adaptive peak?
