## Morning Sessions




### SSB Symposium 8:30 - noon:




#### Unified Approaches for Understanding Patterns of Character Evolution and Diversification





	
  * Stacey Smith (U. of Nebraska-Lincoln) and Boris Igic (U.of Illinois-Chicago) - "Introduction to models of character state-dependent diversification"


Introduces the BiSSE model.

  * Richard Fitzjohn (U. of British Columbia) - "Stochastic mapping incorporating differential diversification"


![]( http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5303/5846583940_998025ba25_o.jpg )


BiSSE comparison to traditional discrete-trait transition rate which ignores the correlation.

	
  * Folmer Bokma (Umeå University) - "Estimating speciation and extinction with incomplete phylogenies"


![]( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3008/5846029951_2424c3127b_o.jpg )


	
  * Emma Goldberg (University of Illinois-Chicago) - "Modes of speciation and character change from phylogenetic trees"

	
  * Peter Wagner (Smithsonian Institution) - "Using stratigraphic compatibility to reveal general relationships between character combinations and diversification"

	
  * P. David Polly (Indiana U.) - "Morphological clocks: why phenotype is a poor predictor of time since common ancestry"




## Afternoon Talks (various sessions)





	
  * Dan Rabosky -- Ecological diversification and niche evolution in the world's most species-rich lizard community.

  * Cecile Ane: What power do comparative methods have to detect shifts in trait evolution and can we consistently estimate their parameters?


Excellent talk, shows: more data doesn't improve estimate of ancestral states as $1\sqrt n$, but does for estimates of $\sigma$ in Brownian motion.  Shows failure of AIC and chi-square approximation in model choice, and derives a correction for BIC.

	
  * Dean Adams: A phylogenetic evolution rate for shape and other multi-dimensional traits

	
  * Ben Redelings: Representing Rogue Taxa with Majority Consensus Tree


Missed this one (missed the schedule change!) but sounds promising.  Instead saw another excellent talk:

	
  * Carl Simpson: Reef coral diversification inferences from the molecular and fossil records


Illustrates how challenging these inferences are without a timeseries fossil record of the diversification.  Decreases in overall species abundances are particularly challenging.


## SSB Presidential Address





	
  * Keith Crandall: The next generation of systematic biology


Apparently the phrase "Next Generation", or at least Next-Gen, is officially synonymous with 454 (star trek watch out).  1 run gets you 1000 taxa x 12 loci 100X coverage with a 454 machine. Wow. But $8000 per run,

Picnic

Debrief day with colleagues,



	
  * met Scott Powell: cool ant diversification (soldiers with large heads to block nest holes mad in trees by beetles).  Interesting trait-dependent diversification possibilities.

	
  * Mike Whitlock- Mostly discussion about data archiving, code archiving, and journal policies.  Happy to say hi and congratulate him for his leadership in this.

	
  * Felsenstein- Priceless stories of the early days of phylogenetics that couldn't be put in his textbook history.




## My Tweet coverage, just for fun




















	
  * Happy to get a chance to meet & thank Mike Whitlock for his leadership on data archiving and chat about future of code archiving [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Hearing the fascinating and conflict-wrought history of early phylogenetic inference at [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) picnic from Joe Felsenstein

	
  * Crandall: good to study species that cabbies study (taxi driver pts him to this discovery:[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news...](http://bit.ly/92uTqk)) [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) [#yespeoplecare](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23yespeoplecare)

	
  * 1 run gets you 1000 taxa x 12 loci 100X coverage with a 454 machine. Wow. But $8000 per run, so don't let the students get too fast [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Crandall: Systematist's dilemma: more genes or more taxa? Next-Gen is to do both with targeted sequencing[#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) SSB pres address

	
  * RT @[K_H_F_H](http://twitter.com/K_H_F_H): LOVE [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) I am in phy. methods I and it is so crowded there are rows of people sitting in the floor [#phylogeneticsareawesome](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23phylogeneticsareawesome)

	
  * Carl Simpson uses coral fossil record to test our ability to estimate species diversification rate - prob to have only + div rates! [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * RT @[BoraZ](http://twitter.com/BoraZ): Lots of cool people tweeting from [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) - if they end up having a tweetup at the bar, I'll be doubly jealous.

	
  * Dean Adams: for multidimensional traits (like shape) we can model diversification with average componentwise brownian rate. [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Cecile Ane says - more data doesn't always buy you more precision. p.s. this means AIC/BIC LR test gonna suck. [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Rabosky shows "phlyogenetic anti-signal" in Aust. lizards - closely related species have greatest differebces in habitat [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * RT @[lukejharmon](http://twitter.com/lukejharmon): Everyone should present statistical results like Emma Goldberg [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Emma Goldberg addresses when traits determining diversification change at speciation only - infer punctuated equib in PuncSSE [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Folmer Bolker shows brilliant entropy-based fit to speciation compared to birth-death models [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) refs pub:[http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-26...](http://bit.ly/kVVVnp)

	
  * Rich FitzJohn describes BiSSE, beautiful but "don't try this with less than 100 species" [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * Looking forward to hearing about the latest methods in character evolution and diversification in SSB Sym in rm OK. E [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11)

	
  * RT @[98prcnt_primate](http://twitter.com/98prcnt_primate): Well if @[JBYoder](http://twitter.com/JBYoder) is switching to [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11), I guess us mortals have not choice.

	
  * Check out the upcoming talks from Wainwright lab at [#evol11](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23evol11) [https://wainwrightlab.wordpress.com/2011...](http://t.co/BDeYpOG)
