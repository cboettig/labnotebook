*Who visits the notebook? Where does that data come from?*


My data comes primarily through Google analytics, though also through comments from colleagues.  Analytics are quite rich, showing visits from around the globe; mostly from university towns.  Visits come in from searches about two thirds of the time. Rest come from links on academic blogs, forums and social media.  Most visitors spend several minutes on a page and view several pages. Some leave comments or contact me directly about an entry, and others share my links on social media like Twitter. 

I say it is difficult because these things are not perfect. Some visitors block analytics or access through RSS feeds instead. Some may view the source code vein on GitHub or the archival copy on figshare. These views aren't reported.  On the other hand, some visitorss may not find what they wanted.  The best information comes from direct interaction with readers -- almost always other academics with an interest in the research, the open science aspects or the technology itself. 




How do users find the notebook?  
-------------------------------

* Google search
* Social media
* RSS feeds
* Other sites
* Direct link


How do users interact with the notebook?
----------------------------------------

* **Page popularity** is one of the most basic statistics to understand.  While finding meaningful baselines is a challenge for any web analytics investigation, one can at least compare relative traffic
* Visitor flow
* Comments
* Mentions and inbound links
* Outging links, citations

Who uses the notebook?
----------------------

This is a more difficult question that can be approached in several ways.  The simplest is geographic:

![Map of user visits from XXX to XXX]()

Resolving geographic data to the city level shows an unsurprising signal of college campuses, particularly evident when these do not align directly with population size at large.  Like the other questions mentioned here, direct feedback and discussions captured in social media provide a more detailed if less representative look at this question. 

Anecdotally I've found that my younger colleagues encounter the content quite often (either by search or direct feed).

Meanwhile my own mentors are less likely to see anything in the notebook (even when I include direct links in emails -- though certainly with better success than I've had linking them to content on Github). That may say more about the hands-off style of my mentors than anything else. 

One interesting aspect of this are the user-specific search results that Google now provides. Even when not signed in to identifying sources such as a GMail account, Google renders results based on geographic area and many other factors.  All of these increase the chance that colleagues (who may or may not be in my social networks recognized by Google, but may also share geographic area, search patterns, and other variables with me) may be more likely to come 
across my pages than others.  

Of course the preponderance of specific
scientific jargon inadequately represented elsewhere on the web
may also increase traffic of those with common interests. No doubt this explains the frequency of inbound searches for GTR+I+G...


Value of the notebook to readers?
--------------------------------

Most notebook entries aren't written to have intrinsic value to general readers. 

Perhaps the hardest question to answer is to measure what value, if any, these readers are finding on the pages they come across. Certainly the answer will differ by user and question. Indirect metrics such as pageviews or the time on a page provide only a rough proxy.  Direct feedback is the most definitive:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Nice tutorial on parsing XML with <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23rstats">#rstats</a> from @<a href="https://twitter.com/cboettig">cboettig</a>: <a href="http://t.co/2W8tG6UVpq" title="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2011/08/26/fishbase-from-r-some-xml-parsing.html">carlboettiger.info/2011/08/26/fisâ€¦</a></p>&mdash; mrgunn (@mrgunn) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgunn/status/320266421227622400">April 5, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Such metrics are less well suited to aggregate questions such as "what content is most useful", though the collective picture of pageviews, comments and feedback weighs on the posts that are intended to be educational, usually on the topic of learning some technical tool or method.  




Some example feedback

Hi Carl,
Given the time and thought you've put into open science, I'm guessing you'd like to know what impact you're having. The 'reproducible research' bug bit me during my PhD but I never did much about it. A major hurdle was transferring all my analyses to a digital and reproducible format. Just getting in the mindset of documenting all my work (a la open lab notebook) made this a natural part of my workflow, instead of an extra inconvenience. I'm mixed on science blogs, but think the open lab notebook is an awesome idea. I found your website I forget how and it provided awesome detail on getting started. I heavily trolled your notes and github which were huge in getting jekyll etc started. I promise you that the time you put into those pages was compensated in my time (...which makes me a parasite I guess...). Score another for open science. Not sure if I can help in any immediate way, but let me know if I can. Cheers and keep up the awesome work!

Hi Carl,
I have been looking at your labnotebook repo a ton over the last few days as I set up a blog. Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your commitment to putting all your work and code out in the open. It's this spirit that makes the internet great!

Best,

Justin

Hey Carl, 

I started reading your lab notebook which provided very interesting insights to workflow management for scientific manuscripts. I am determined to use a similar workflow now and was hoping to take examples from your "ews review" on github.

I get most of it, however, I was looking for the knitr ".Rmd" document to understand the global chunk settings and how you integrated everything together to produce the manuscript. I could only find the final .md files. I assume you used pandoc to convert into pdf? 

Really appreciate your effort towards the open lab notebook. Better late than never, I intend to start one myself thanks to you!

Best Regards,

Vijay

Carl,
    hope you don't mind the 'cold-call' but I was impressed with your GitHub Pages web site and have been trying to implement the same. I lecture in a small college in NW Ireland and am transitioning much of my programming exercises for my classes to GitHub. 

...

Rgds,
J
