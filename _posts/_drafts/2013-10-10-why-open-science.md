> I’d much rather be relevant. In science, that’s harder than anything else. 

- C. Titus Brown, in an interview on challenges and opportunities in practicing open data, appearing in [AJA News](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/10/scientists-threatenedbydemandstosharedata.html)


I think most researchers share a firm belief in the inestimable long term value basic science holds for society. A central tenant of this belief is that these benefits are completely unpredictable -- while they may arise from only a small fraction of basic research; neither the researchers, funders, or public at large can predict what those outcomes will be.  It is a belief in serendipitous value for the reuse of research in unforseen ways that justifies public support.  Unsurpisingly, former NSF Director Subra Saresh speaks about this more eloquently than almost anyone.  From him I picked up my favorite statistic to this effect, for which Victoria provides more recent numbers in her report: estimated return on the $3.8 billion dollars of federal money spent on the Human Genome project was $796 billion -- over $209 dollars for every dollar invested.
