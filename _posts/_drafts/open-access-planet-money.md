Wondering if I can convince NPR's Planet Money to do a story on the economics of academic publishing and open access.  Seems right up there ally.  Drafting a pitch in the notebook.  




In an industry widely held to be struggling, one corner continues to command profit margins higher than Apple.  It is a story of seemingly inexplicable prices, allegations of anti-comptetive behavior, wasted taxpayer dollars, and the role of government. A protest launched by mathematicians, leading to a tide of pressure for change which the Economist likened to the Arab Spring.  It is the story of academic publishing.  

Last Friday, The Whitehouse responded to a petition of over 70,000 signatures calling for open access



We hear a lot about how poorly traditional publishing has been doing in today's digital economy.  Yet there is a corner of that publishing industry, a multi-billion dollar corner, whose profit margins that beat Apple (42%). Academic publishers whethered the transition to digital media rather well, and are experienced practioners of the paywall model that has only more recently been adopted by major venues such as the New York Times and Wallstreet.  In fact, if smaller bloggers want to follow the path of Andrew Sullivan, they need look no further for a strategy.  Big publishers such as Elseiver bundle huge numbers of subscriptions to obscure journals into packages with the journals a library just cannot live without.  

Yet a far more radical model has been on the rise.  One in which the author pays the publishing costs up front, and then the articles are distributed freely for anyone to read.  Prices per article can be upwards of $5000.  

What is the real value of an article?  

## Questions about the economics of academic publishing: 

* Can the market control price in subsciption based, bundle model?
* Where does the price-per-article come from?  
* are taxpayers really getting charged twice?
* What is the economic value of open access publishing driven by industry access?  




Does selectivity (e.g. peer review exepenses) or front-matter drive the high per-article publication cost at top venues?  


Added value debate.  One of the big questions in determining price is the value added by the publication service.  Academics can easily reach their colleagues without the help of publishers through the interent.  No where is this more keenly demonstrated than on the preprint server arXiv, where physicists deposit the articles they write before sending them to publishers for peer review and editing. 

(Footnote: Ironically, this model predates not only the digital age but the publishers themselves.  Before the advent of academic journals in the 1600s, researchers simply wrote letters to their colleagues.  It became more efficient to read such letters out at a meeting of many scientists than write to everyone separately. Clever societies sponsoring such meetings then created the first journals as a means of distributing these letters to those who could not attend the meeting to hear the letters read).  

Many say that the primary value provided by the publisher is the hallowed Peer Review process -- yet the reviewers and often the editors coordinating the reviews are all done on a purely voluntary basis, with almost no acknowledgement (many papers end with simple thanks to "two anonymous reviewers who provided helpful comments"). While the publisher also performs proofreading and typesetting, these services hardly justify the price tags and are as frequently a source of complaint as they are a service to the authors.  In most cases, the real value publishers offer is the prestige of their brand.  

Is that a value to author or the reader?  As a reader, do you value an article because it has gone through a highly selective filter, or because it has been widely and successfully promoted as something everyone will read?  



This prestige is everything in the academic reputation economy.  The best journals can promise much better readership, and that more important metric: citations by other scientists, through their prestigous brand name recognition as the "best science has to offer" and their expensive network of editors and journalists who continually promote the work.  This is a great service to the author rather than the reader.  The reader's benefits have largely been performed before the promotional material launches -- the readers pay for the highly selective filter of peer review.  The journals with the greatest author services -- the best promotion machines -- are entirely paid for by the readers.  These journals argue that an author-pays model would be prohibitively expensive, that the market would not support the expensive promotional efforts that are so important to their brand.  So in effect, we are content to have the entire community (e.g. readers) pay for promotional content of certain authors that the authors themselves would not pay for.  


Decentralize everything?  No one wants to read every article in a journal, or every journal in the library.  In music industry, we went from paying for albums to paying for invididual songs.  What if we paid by article accessed, rather than by 


Academic publishers can get up to some strange things at times.  Like the time Elsiever [invented a fake journal to help sell drugs](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090503/1255574725.shtml) or it's dabbling in the [arms trade buisness](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/may/30/armstrade.weaponstechnology)


The Economist described it as the Academic Spring.
