Collaborative benefits of the Git/Github model

Online access, Off-line access 
-----------------------------

Edit anywhere.  Though many sites that have the benefit of online access
through browser-based editors like the Wordpress dashboard, this brings
the corresponding disadvantages that they cannot be accessed or edited
without a decent Internet connection, and typically require users to work
in their browser-based editor rather than their prefered text-editing
environment, such as vim (though of course technical work-arounds are
available).  This site sits in a local repository where it can easily
be edited off-line.

Commenting 
----------

Commenting is actually the weakest system, as the data is not easily
accessible to archiving or management.
