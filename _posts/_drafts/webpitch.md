Science is growing exponentially.  Wether measured in the number of papers published per hour, or data deposited central databases, this growth frequently even outpaces Moore's law, making it challenging even for computers to keep up. (A pattern which exactly anticipated the vogue of "Big Data", operationally defined as enough data that its size is a defining challenge in its use).  

Both public and private funders and publishers are responding to this.  NSF now requires data management plans and recognizes non-paper 'products of research'.  Many Evolution and ecology journals have mandated data archiving in public repositories as a condition of publication.  Preprints are on the rise as they become the hallmark of a fast-moving field. Ecological synthesis centers continue to prove a successful model to encourage and train ecologists to analyze existing data; DataONE attacts $5 million over 5 years for unified data management framework, aand NEON attracts over $300 million over 30 years for streaming data collection.  

Themes: Reproducibility, Scalibility

While ostensibly good ideas for science as a whole, these changes can create problems more rapidly than they can solve them.  

With the growing literature (and to some extent data), filtering becomes a significant problem.  Being able to reproduce, extend, and apply new results in other contexts is becoming more and more challenging (owing partly to the complexity of analyses themselves) just at the very time when we need 


Never has there been more data that is easily available to practicing ecologists that is simultaneously inaccessible or obtainable with only undo effort.  Just as any researcher should be able to confirm there reasoning with simple mathematical examples or numerical simulations, they should have data to at their fingertips least ask preliminary and broad questions.  


We are pursuing the application of methods developed in other fields.  Translation and uptake of these ideas take time, and it always will.  But some things make the process slower and less reliable than it needs to be.
