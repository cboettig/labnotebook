## rOpenSci
	
* rOpenSci wins runner up prize in PLoS + Mendeley's Binary Battle!
* Write replies to interview questions with Mendeley.
* roxygenizing documentation for RMendeley -- about half done


## pdg-control 

* Call with Jake scheduled for tomorrow
* Emails with Michael. I'll implement delay intervals, he'll add costs to adjustment.
* Need to fix/finish delay interval optimization calculation (exponent of matrix & beta)


## Warning Signals

Meeting with Alan

* Regime shifts
* Emphasize the RO curve in uncertainty analysis
* SeeÂ  (Dulvy _et. al._ 2003) (relevant) & (more for fun) (Le Quesne & Jennings, 2012)

## Seminars


Excellent [discussion panel](http://innovation.ucdavis.edu/events/getting-famous-or-getting-scooped-risks-and-opportunities-in-sharing-your-science-and-scholarship) with Jonathan Eisen, Jon Wilbanks, and Mario Biagioli. Looks like the beginning of a successful collaboration between Davis Open Science and the Center for Science & Innovation Studies at UC Davis.

## Evolution

* Evolution manuscript accepted, pending a few minor checks.
* Complete documentation and submit associated pmc package

## Wrightscape debugging process

Into the C code, checking the equations & implementation of the likelihood calculation.
