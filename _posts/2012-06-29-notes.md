### Critical transitions

Must determine the correct set of comparisons:  

* Solve the SDP optim using the exact time dependent  
* Simulate under an f with the same escapement policy but different functional form, i.e. logistic with K & r estimated from the May example, either analytically or directly from the data.  
* Considering the [costs of "cautious policy"](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/ef5148047563ca8e1bd05d4d946161cc64364f16/inst/examples/cautious.md) (calculates optimal harvest recursively but always selects a fraction P of the optimal.)   Results in non-constant escapement rules:

Also has nonlinear (convex) impact on value.   


Filing out the boxes:

* the value of no action, no shift -- NPV under assumed model
* the value of no action, shift -- depends when shift occurs.  Assume worst?  
* value of action, no shift -- Action is p = ?  
* value of action, shift -- action is p = ?  Under what shift process? 
* Consider the single-timestep decision first.  Then the repeated decision.  

### Value of information

* [logistic, lognormal](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/8373d9ae215cb49bceb5f8b2684078335ce68e44/inst/examples/logistic_lognormal.md) (any measurement error is most conservative, then determinstic.  gi the least)
* Beverton-Holt, lognormal ([early version of figures](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/0a43d3e60966b9af9ad6adfe7c3ff4a62638226a/inst/examples/value_of_information.md)) deterministic is _least_ conservative, measurement errors, combined errors most. (Rerunning as bh_lognormal.Rmd) 
* [logistic, uniform](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/2d6d42f04de6df2fdca6a16a67c8a665b202a8f6/inst/examples/voi_sethi_parameters.md) (deterministic is always most conservative.  gi is least)
* [Beverton-Holt, uniform](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/2d6d42f04de6df2fdca6a16a67c8a665b202a8f6/inst/examples/bh_uniform.md) (deterministic is most conservative, growth noise is least!)


* constructed bias table: optimal under low/med/high r by implement under low/med/high r.  ([results](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/793e531ea6a767245afa6b2e57681eb59fbbcfe6/inst/examples/bias_table.md))
