title: Evolutionary Regime Shift examples
---






 








Time to get more data and examples to start testing methods,
particularly for cases in where regime shifts are hypothesized by
painting a tree. Starting a Mendeley public collection for the
literature in Web of Science that actually applies either the OUCH or
Brownie framework to identify shifts in rates of continuous trait
evolution.

 now I'll have to see how hard it is to obtain both the trees and trait
data...

\

-   Web of Science has 77 papers citing Butler and King 2004, of 21
    promising-looking ones 13 actually applied (or came close enough) to
    applying a regime-based method (some of these actually used Brownie
    but make mention of the ouch approach. Smith Sa, Beaulieu JM. 2009
    actually comments about no method existing to vary alpha across
    trees. 47 cite O'Meara et al. 2006, with considerable overlap.

-   Edwards & Smith evaluate a fantastically large data set painted with
    C3 and C4 plants looking at temperature analysis.

-   Andrew Hipp's datasets on chromosome evolution in sedges might be a
    good place to start. Data is included in his *maticce* R package
    (built on ouch).
