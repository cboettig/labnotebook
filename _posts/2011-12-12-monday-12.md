* Wrote method2 test functions out in knitr/sweave. Sent document to Peter.
* Move my ropensci git origins to the ropensci github page.
* Ropensci comments on \dontrun: recommended for anything non-trivial, including web calls. Richer tests should be put into testthat.
* Reply to Charles Jervis, biology high school teacher interested in tools to teach math/modeling in ecology.  Sounds like he's already doing some cool stuff with phylogenies with his students.
* prepare vignette for rfishbase based on tutorial.
* prepare vignette for treebase base on tutorial.


## Misc Wordpress/Notebook Stuff


Kcite upgrade -- moves to a new platform, becomes author-year format, smaller format bibliography.  Whoops, it also breaks my dynamic header-footers -- for some reason they no longer appear on any page or post not calling the kcite citation!  Fixed with a hack call to kcite function in my footer


```html
<!-- MY ADDITION: KCITE HACK -->
<script type="text/javascript">
       var kcite_citation_data;
if( kcite_citation_data == undefined ){
kcite_citation_data = [];
}
</script>
```


but not happy about this.
