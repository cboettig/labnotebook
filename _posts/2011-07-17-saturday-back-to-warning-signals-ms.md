#### New outline

1.  "An increasing recognition"
2.   "proof-of-principle" - reliability is unknown
3.   "Cries wolf"
4.   ROC, Fig 1
5.   tau
6.   method
7.   data, Fig 2
8.   analysis, Fig 3
9.   enough data Fig 4
10.   disclaimer
11.   conclusion

#### Former Outline

1. Early Warning matter, no-one does statistics
2. We need quantify uncertainty stats
3. ROC curve shows this trade-off
4. ROC also compares different methods & data sizes (i.e. Fig 4)
5. Quantifying “increasing variance” etc — we’ll use tau
6. We’ll also do a likelihood-based method
7. Introduce the datasets
8. ROC curves on the data, Fig 3
9. Quantifying data necessary, Fig 4
10. Disclaimers: Not completely general
11. Conclusion

Implemented comments, mostly. Still mentions trade-off ahead before presenting ROC curve. Sent draft back to Alan.
