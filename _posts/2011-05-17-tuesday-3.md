  * Finished review for TE

	
  * Shared post on TreeBASE API

	
  * Reviewed Scott's updates to dryad R API, adjusted formatting.

	
  * Looking at [documentation for the OAI-MPH queries](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ListIdentifiers), don't seem to be as rich as Phylo-ws queries.  This is why treeBASE metadata searches tend to download the full metadata set into R and query that.  Looks like we'll need to take a similar approach to Dryad, as it doesn't seem like there's a way to query the API by author name at all?

	
  * run of Parrotfish example with intensive simulated annealing.
