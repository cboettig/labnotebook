### RNeXML

- Feedback from Rutger, need to add `about` attributes so that RDFa abstraction references the right level of the DOM (issue [#35](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/35)).  
- Looking for strategy for distilling RDF from RDFa in R, see [my question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20026540/distill-rdfa-into-rdf-xml-in-r).  Hopefully don't have to wrap some C library myself...

### nonparametric-bayes

Writing writing.  

- Update pandoc templates to use yaml metadata for author, affiliation, abstract, etc.  Avoids having to manually edit the `elsarticle.latex` template with this metadata.  Added [fork](https://github.com/cboettig/pandoc-templates/) for my templates, e.g. see my  [elsarticle.latex](https://github.com/cboettig/pandoc-templates/blob/f348513558c9189ef28f0aef06fe3031d7a17d96/elsarticle.latex).  Example metadata in [manuscript](https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes/blob/a1801c525142d4bb64555721403d869ecfbde8d4/inst/doc/nonparametric-bayes.Rmd).  

- fixing xtable caption (as argument)

- Extended discussion.  Adjustments to figures.  See commit log /diffs for details.
