Graduate Teaching Community -- reflections on teaching
------------------------------------------------------

Haven't made a lot of entries in this notebook as I'm not teaching
regularly at the moment, though am still attending meetings of the
Graduate Teaching Community, a record of which can be found on our [GTC
blog](http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com "http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com"). But
today in GTC we are thinking about reflections on teaching, and starting
with a little bit of journaling, so this seemed like a good place to do
it.

Cass and Karolyn have started us off writing on a few pre-reflection
questions:

-   What are my learning goals for this lesson/course/class?

Often I emphasize problem solving, while I feel my students tend to
emphasize factual content as the goal, and de-value problem solving
ability. It is this latter perception that I'm most challenged by, and
how to change it. The other challenge I think on most is student
ownership of content. Not sure I can really define that, I guess it's a
feeling of mastery, or perhaps just familiarity with the content that's
the goal.

-   What do I want to improve about my own teaching today?

\

-   What assumptions do I have about my students when they enter my
    classroom? How do these assumptions affect my interactions with
    them, and what and how I teach?

Notes from the rest of the session
----------------------------------

-   Cycle: **Prepare, Enact, Reflect.**
-   Terminology: Procedural Reflection (what happened?) vs Task Analysis
    (what worked?) vs Critical Reflection (so what impact?). (see [Peter
    Ademie](http://www.uri.edu/hss/education/faculty/adamy.html "http://www.uri.edu/hss/education/faculty/adamy.html"),
    [Tyrone
    Howard](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_into_practice/v042/42.3howard.html#top "http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_into_practice/v042/42.3howard.html#top"))
-   Reflection usually starts with teacher, then curriculum, then
    student. (i.e. early evaluation focuses on my handwriting on the
    blackboard, much more experienced teachers reflect on assumptions
    about student).

### Different Kinds of Reflection

-   Discussion of **[Lesson
    Study](http://www.lessonstudygroup.net/ "http://www.lessonstudygroup.net/")**
    process. [Informational
    video](http://www.lessonstudygroup.net/05r4informational_videos.html "http://www.lessonstudygroup.net/05r4informational_videos.html").
    Basically, large numbers of teachers watch students learn. Began in
    Japan. Evaluates the lesson itself, not the teacher.
-   Sharing practices:
    -   Karolyn: Asks for questions / comments on index cards from
        students.
    -   Cass: [Online teaching
        journal](http://cassandrapaul.net/wordpress/ "http://cassandrapaul.net/wordpress/").
        Reflect soon after works best!
    -   Robert (in abstentia) blue book responses -- students write
        comments about what is working, he writes back in their
        notebooks.
