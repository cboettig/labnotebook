-   Basically I want to apply central limit theorem for stationary
    processes (accounts for covariances), assuming mean zero

![ \\frac{X\_1 + ... + X\_n}{\\sqrt{\\sigma\^2 n}} \\propto N(0,1)
](http://openwetware.org/images/math/1/4/1/141abb117709d04302d240f2cbbf2df6.png)

where

![ \\sigma\^2 = E X\^2 + 2 \\sum\_{i,j}\^n Cov(X\_i, X\_j)
](http://openwetware.org/images/math/2/b/7/2b7baf7dc6d72616ccd1a5d72d4323cf.png)

-   Discussion of
    [Freidlinâ€“Wentzell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freidlin%E2%80%93Wentzell_theorem "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freidlin%E2%80%93Wentzell_theorem")
    theory in connection to Arrhenius law and the well-defined
    stochastic tipping point which occurs before the branch point.
-   Kurtz results don't really help in the case of ergodicity, can make
    statements about the (even non-stationary) ensemble limit.
