Lou Gross
---------

- Big picture: big data, computational challenges.  
- NEON, DataONE, ADW, iDigBio
- "Convergence" as the new interdisciplinary (National Academies)
- Rise of synthesis centers
- "Enabling architecture for next gen life science research" -- National Academies report Lou Gross (2013)
- Comp Science for Natural Resource Management  -- Fuller, Wang, Gross (2007)

- language barriers: What's a model?  Mouse, drosophila?  logistic, ricker?  GIS map layers? ...

Contraints frequently dominate, not the control or the state equation.  

Let stakeholders make their own rankings. Scenario analysis vs optimal control.  Uncertainies! "Relative assessment protocol" Fuller, Gross, Duke-Sylvester, Palmer.  "Testing the robustness of management descions under uncertainty" (ATLSS modeling)



### Breakouts

notes from my breakout session: 

#### Questions 

- Sensitivity analysis of Scenario Rankings
- What does a Resilience approach add
- Generalities  

#### Tools for decision under uncertainty

- optimization
- threshold planning 
- scenario planning 
- resilience thinking

(Polasky et al 2011 TREE)

#### optimization 

- Info gap "theory" 
- Satisfiability / mini-max 
- model approximation methods 
- dynamic programming 

#### Leading Challenges  
 
- To what extent are these approaches different sides of the same coin? 
- Are there truly non-optimization based approaches? 
- Almost-optimal approaches 
- Including constraints


####  what we do well

- Optimize easy problems
- open loop 

#### State-of-the-art 

- Starting to: simulate optimal solutions to simple problems under more realistic circumstances
- Starting to find multiple "optima" 
- feedback control (SDP)
- Dual-control / adaptive control / active adaptive management / learning 
- large state space

#### Open challenges / what we do poorly

- Dual control under parameter uncertainty (without restrictive assumptions on parameters)
- high-dimensional problems 
- multiple stake-holders / game-theory solutions (outside fisheries)
- mapping between control and implementation (partial controllability)
- large action space
- (multiple) delayed effect actions

#### Open challenges: Multiple stake-holder games

- beyond 2-player differential games (with feedback)
- simultaneous player actions 

#### Open challenges: adaptive management timescales

- frequency of revisiting decisions
- biological timescales
- political timescales 


#### Known nuisances

- curse of dimensionality
- data collection methods
- numerical methods 
- local vs global

#### Missed things 

- spatial data, using rich data under the curse of dimensionality

## ropensci

Writing out proof-of-principle interface to the dataone REST API, see [rdataone](https://github.com/ropensci/rdataone/) and [Introduction to the package](https://github.com/ropensci/rdataone/issues/1)


Key things: 

- We can accomplish handling of certificates from httr, just add `config = list(sslcert = )`; see `?httr::config`, e.g. archive a file with: 

```r
httr::PUT(paste0("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v1/archive/", 
                         "urn:uuid:0bf9cf50-6b6b-45ad-b22c-ffd0ee2a21c3"), 
                                        config=config(sslcert = "/tmp/x509up_u1000"))

```

Posting new data requires writing a system metadata XML file.  Currently have a crude minimal version of this, [write_sysmeta.R](https://github.com/ropensci/rdataone/blob/6b0a8e9d53768c4e739179923681a053c13552a8/R/write_sysmeta.R), should see how `dataone` package is handling this.
