Working on likelihood ratio/phylogenetic signal manuscript.

### scrap notes from more literature combing

-   Cheverud 1985 autocorellational model, extended by Gittlman & Kot
    1990
-   Grafen 89, Pagen & Harvey 89 extending PIC to polytomies
-   Harvey & Mace 82, Harvey & Clutton Brock 85 taxonomic rather than
    phylogenetic

From Blomberg et al: "The three best-justified phylogenetically based
statistical methods can all be applied with a star phylogeny, in which
case they yield results that are exactly the same as a conventional
analysis (phylogenetically independent contrasts: Felsenstein 1985;
generalized least squares: Grafen 1989; Martins and Hansen 1997; Garland
and Ives 2000; Rohlf 2001; Monte Carlo simulations: Martins and Garland
1991; Garland et al. 1993; Reynolds and Lee 1996)"

-   papers claiming: apply only if significant

(e.g., Gittleman and Kot 1990; Gittleman et al. 1996a; Abouheif 1999).
Gittleman and Luh 1992
