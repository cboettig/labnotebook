### RNeXML

- Example methods for metadata: https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/20#issuecomment-26457772
- Closes #19 https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/19#issuecomment-26459110
- Discussion of best identifiers for OTUs [#24](https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/24). Now waiting on Scott for choice of implementation


### Misc 

#### R puzzle

In R's S4 methods, I can define methods with different signatures, i.e. different object classes for the same function call.  But can I alter the names and number of arguments for a method?  



As usual, see Github for details on commits and issues.
