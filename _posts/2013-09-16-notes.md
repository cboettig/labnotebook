## ropensci

Have implemented a solution to extending `data.frame` with metadata that I was [tackling the other day](http://carlboettiger.info/2013/09/11/extending-data-frame-class.html).  This raises several open questions on how we do the implementation, including whether we restrict this extension to providing the `attributeList`-level metadata (or a subset thereof), or if we allow higher level nodes of `eml` to act as extensions of `data.frame` (e.g. `dataTable`, which provides additional metadata attributes such as `entityTitle`, as well as the `physical` description of the `csv` file.  

Matt raises good points about what attribute data we want. Most we have addressed already, but this does raise additional challenges as well.  See issue [#47](https://github.com/ropensci/reml/issues/47) for details and further discussion.  


## Reading

Started catching up on some backlog of warning signals literature.  

- [Litzow et al, Ecology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-0670.1 "Rising catch variability preceded historical fisheries collapses in Alaska")
- [Scheff et al, JTB](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.08.011 "Predicting critical transitions in a model of systemic inflammation")
- [Corrado et al, ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICNF.2013.6578895 "Signals of critical transitions in ecosystems associated with fluctuations of spatial patterns")
- [Kuhn et al, arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8250 "Critical Transitions in Social Network Activity").  Because something is a event (e.g. Thanksgiving) doesn't make it a "critical transition"... What's the state-space? The slowly-changing parameter? What's the model?
