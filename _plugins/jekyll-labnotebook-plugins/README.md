## Jekyll Labnotebook Plugins

* Author: Carl Boettiger, <cboettig@gmail.com>
* Released under the MIT license.

**Disclaimer**: These plugins are under active development for use
in my research lab notebook, which is built on Jekyll ([Visit the
notebook sourcecode on github](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook)).
Consequently the scripts are built for my custom objectives rather than
providing a general Liquid/Jekyll interface to the relevant APIs.  Still,
anyone should feel free to customize the scripts for their own site and
file issues and bugs.  Most of the settings are best adjusted at in the
Ruby code to adjust output appearance, etc.  As I get better with Ruby
and Liquid I may roll these up as proper generic plugins.
