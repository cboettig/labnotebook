Philosophy
----------

![floatright](/assets/img/watch.png) I am passionate about experiential,
active learning that is problem-based, social, interdisciplinary,
quantitative and leverages technology. Though borne out of my own
experience as both student and instructor, my approach is also
influenced by the examples of such thinkers as Nobel laureate
[Carl Wieman](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.340.6130.292
"profile in Science Magazine (pdf)"), Professor [Eric
Mazur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI
"lecture on teaching (YouTube recording)") and [Sir Ken
Robinson](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html
"TED talk").  Good teaching practices should be rooted in scientific
study, not anecdote; and much of this philosophy is well borne
out in the educational research literature.  Pieces that have
been particularly influential for me include the evidence for
the value of collaborative problem-solving in science education
([Anderson et al. 2011](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1198280
"Science education.  Changing the culture of science education at
research universities.")); the immense evidence for active learning,
([Cornelius-White 2007](http://doi.org/10.3102/003465430298563
"Learner-Centered Teacher-Student Relationships Are Effective: A
Meta-Analysis")); the road-map for quantitative, interdisciplinary
and research driven biology training ([Bialek & Botstein
2004](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1095480 "Introductory science and
mathematics education for 21st-Century biologists.")). I am also
interested in how approaches such as the use of social media ([Junco,
et al 2010](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00387.x "The
effect of Twitter on college student engagement and grades")), peer
instruction, and delibrate practice ([Deslauriers, Schelew & Wieman
2011](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1201783 "Improved Learning in a
Large-Enrollment Physics Class")) can bring some of the benefits of
small classes into large lectures.

Experience
----------

I have been an instructor at the [Bodega Phylogenetics Workshop
(2011)](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/2011_Workshop), an intensive
1-week course that draws about 40 students from around the world to
learn the latest methods in phylogenetics. I teach a
[section](http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/Continuous_Character_Evolution_%28Boettiger%29_2011)
on comparative methods and basic programming. I taught upper-division
undergraduate students in biology, mathematics and computers science
through the NSF training initiative [CLIMB](http://climb.ucdavis.edu/)
(Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology)
program at UC Davis in spring and summer of 2008. A diverse group of
eight students designed and conducted a research project into
meta-population dynamics of avian influenza and organized a conference
of academics, state epidemiologists, and representatives from chicken
industry to present and discuss their findings. I have been a teaching
assistant for introductory biology (1B), a lab-driven course introducing
students to fundamentals of zoology. I have been involved in outdoor
education for eight years, where I have gained experience in group
dynamics and facilitation, leadership theory and active learning. On
campus I have helped lead the [Graduate Student Teaching
Community](http://gtc-blog.blogspot.com), where graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows can discuss and practice new teaching strategies.
I'm a member of the Center for Learning and Excellence at UC Davis. I
also enjoy educational outreach, particularly where it combines active
learning, technology and biology. I've worked with middle school
teachers on how to use simple computer simulation software
([netlogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) to provide an
exploratory approach to teaching ecology and evolution in the [SIRC
program](http://sasp.ucdavis.edu),
and have gave a guest lecture on ecological dynamics at [University of
the Pacific](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/843). I'm a
[member](http://www.nationallabnetwork.org/scientists/b1412e8c-1348-f09a-d368-919e80c4ee07)
of the [National Lab Network](http://www.nationallabnetwork.org) and I
keep an open [teaching
notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/categories.html#teaching)
where I reflect on my experiences.

Education Research
------------------

While teaching with CLIMB I had the chance to work alongside a graduate
student from the UC Davis department of Education who was writing her
thesis on the program, and first introduced me to some of the recent
research in effective education. Davis has several excellent research
programs in higher education, within the education department and
beyond, such as the physics education research track and the highly
successful Physics 7 program, as well as the CLIMB program. I am quite
interested educational research and a scientific approach to education,
and as such try to follow a bit of what is going on in the educational
literature. The papers mentioned above provide some of the foundational
philosophy towards education. I maintain a [Mendeley reading
list](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/530011/education)
of articles I encounter that may be of interest to others wanting to
know more about educational research.  <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/groups/530011/education/feed/rss"><i class="icon-rss"></i></a>
