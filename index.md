I am a graduate student with [Alan Hastings](http://two.ucdavis.edu/%7Eme "Alan Hastings") in the
[Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/) Ph.D program
at UC Davis, working on regime shifts in ecology and evolution. Such
shifts mark the most dramatic events in complex systems; understanding
and forecasting these events challenges the capacity of both our
statistical methods and the data available. My
[research](http://www.carlboettiger.info/research) aims to extend and
quantify the limits of understanding through uncertainty modeling, high
performance computing and large data sets. I am funded by a DoE
Computational Science Graduate Fellowship
([CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/community/fellows/profile?n=boettiger)).
I keep an open [lab
notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/research/lab-notebook), as I
describe in this
[introduction](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/211).
